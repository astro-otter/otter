    from 70 transient sources that have been classiﬁed as tidal
    disruption events (TDEs) in the literature. We explore the
    properties of these candidates, using nearly three decades of X-ray
    observations to quantify their properties and characteristics. We
    ﬁnd that the emission from X-ray TDEs increase by two to three
    orders of magnitude, compared to pre-ﬂare constraints. These
    emissions evolve signiﬁcantly with time, and decay with power-law
    indices that are typically shallower than the canonical t−5/3 decay
    law, implying that X-ray TDEs are viscously delayed. These events
    exhibit enhanced (relative to galactic) column densities and are
    quite soft in nature, with no strong correlation between the amount
    of detected soft and hard emission. At their peak, jetted events
    have an X-ray to optical ratio ?1, whereas non-jetted events have a
    ratio ∼1, which suggests that these events undergo reprocessing at
    different rates. X-ray TDEs have long T90 values, consistent with
    what would be expected from a viscously driven accretion disk formed
    by the disruption of a main-sequence star by a black hole with a
    mass {\textless{}}107 Me. The isotropic luminosities of X-ray TDEs
    are bimodal, such that jetted and non-jetted events are separated by
    a “reprocessing valley” that we suggest is naturally populated by
    optical/UV TDEs that most likely produce X-rays, but this emission
    is “veiled” from observations due to reprocessing. Our results
    suggest that non-jetted X-ray TDEs likely originate from partial
    disruptions and/or disruptions of low-mass stars.}

  abstract = {AbstractWe present a systematic analysis of the X-ray
    emission of a sample of 17 optically selected, X-ray-detected tidal
    disruption events (TDEs) discovered between 2014 and 2021. The X-ray
    light curves show a diverse range of temporal behaviors, with most
    sources not following the expected power-law decline. The X-ray
    spectra are mostly extremely soft and consistent with thermal
    emission from the innermost region of an accretion disk, which cools
    as the accretion rate decreases. Three sources show formation of a
    hard X-ray corona at late times. The spectral energy distribution
    shape, probed by the ratio ( L BB / L X ) between the UV/optical and
    X-ray, shows a wide range of L BB / L X ∈ (0.5, 3000) at early times
    and converges to disklike values of L BB / L X ∈ (0.5, 10) at late
    times. We estimate the fraction of optically discovered TDEs with L
    X ≥ 10 42 erg s −1 to be at least 40\% and show that X-ray loudness
    is independent of black hole mass. We argue that distinct disk
    formation timescales are unlikely to be able to explain the diverse
    range of X-ray evolution. We combine our sample with
    X-ray-discovered ones to construct an X-ray luminosity function,
    best fit by a broken power law, with a break at L X ≈ 10 44 erg s −1
    . We show that there is no dichotomy between optically and
    X-ray-selected TDEs; instead, there is a continuum of early-time L
    BB / L X , at least as wide as L BB / L X ∈ (0.1, 3000), with
    optical/X-ray surveys selecting preferentially, but not exclusively,
    from the higher/lower end of the distribution. Our findings are
    consistent with unification models for the overall TDE population.}

    time-domain optical and soft X-ray surveys, both of which are prone
    to significant obscuration. The infrared (IR), however, is a
    powerful probe of dust-enshrouded environments; hence, we recently
    performed a systematic search of NEOWISE mid-IR data for nearby,
    obscured TDEs within roughly 200 Mpc. We identified 18 TDE
    candidates in galactic nuclei, using difference imaging to uncover
    nuclear variability among significant host galaxy emission. These
    candidates were selected based on the following IR light-curve
    properties: (1) L W2 ≳ 1042 erg s‑1 at peak; (2) fast rise, followed
    by a slow, monotonic decline; (3) no significant prior variability;
    and (4) no evidence for active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity in
    Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) colors. The majority of
    these sources showed no variable optical counterpart, suggesting
    that optical surveys indeed miss numerous obscured TDEs. Using
    narrow-line ionization levels and variability arguments, we
    identified six sources as possible underlying AGN, yielding a total
    of 12 TDEs in our gold sample. This gold sample yields a lower limit
    on the IR-selected TDE rate of (2.0 ± 0.3) × 10‑5 galaxy‑1 yr‑1
    ((1.3 ± 0.2) × 10‑7 Mpc‑3 yr‑1), which is comparable to optical and
    X-ray TDE rates. The IR-selected TDE host galaxies do not show a
    green valley overdensity nor as a preference for quiescent, Balmer
    strong galaxies, which are both overrepresented in optical and X-ray
    TDE samples. This IR-selected sample represents a new population of
    dusty TDEs that have historically been missed by optical and X-ray
    surveys and helps alleviate tensions between observed and
    theoretical TDE rates and the so-called missing energy problem.}

    The LSST design is driven by four main science themes: probing dark
    energy and dark matter, taking an inventory of the solar system,
    exploring the transient optical sky, and mapping the Milky Way. LSST
    will be a large, wide-field ground-based system designed to obtain
    repeated images covering the sky visible from Cerro Pachón in
    northern Chile. The telescope will have an 8.4 m (6.5 m effective)
    primary mirror, a 9.6 deg2 field of view, a 3.2-gigapixel camera,
    and six filters (ugrizy) covering the wavelength range 320-1050 nm.
    The project is in the construction phase and will begin regular
    survey operations by 2022. About 90\% of the observing time will be
    devoted to a deep-wide-fast survey mode that will uniformly observe
    a 18,000 deg2 region about 800 times (summed over all six bands)
    during the anticipated 10 yr of operations and will yield a co-added
    map to r ∼ 27.5. These data will result in databases including about
    32 trillion observations of 20 billion galaxies and a similar number
    of stars, and they will serve the majority of the primary science
    programs. The remaining 10\% of the observing time will be allocated
    to special projects such as Very Deep and Very Fast time domain
    surveys, whose details are currently under discussion. We illustrate
    how the LSST science drivers led to these choices of system
    parameters, and we describe the expected data products and their
    characteristics.}

  abstract = {Recent observations presented in Cendes et al. (2024a)
    show that optically selected tidal disruption events (TDEs) commonly
    produce delayed radio emission that can peak years post-disruption.
    Here, we explore the multi-wavelength properties of a sample of
    radio-observed optically selected TDEs to shed light on the physical
    process(es) responsible for the late-rising radio emission. We
    combine new late-time X-ray observations with archival optical, UV,
    X-ray, and radio data to conclude that a diversity of
    accretion-driven outflows may power delayed radio emission in TDEs.
    Simultaneous X-ray data and modeling of the UV/optical emission
    suggest that some late radio outflows may be launched by a delayed
    phase of super-Eddington accretion onto the central supermassive
    black hole (SMBH), while others may result from a state transition
    to a "low-hard" radiatively inefficient accretion flow or the
    deceleration of an off-axis relativistic jet. We additionally find
    weak statistical evidence that TDEs with delayed radio emission have
    larger optical/UV photospheric radii than other TDEs and are less
    likely to exhibit helium emission lines at early times, possibly
    also supporting the hypothesis that the onset of SMBH accretion is
    delayed in these systems. Our results have implications for our
    understanding of state changes in SMBH accretion flows, the
    circularization timescale for TDE debris, and the prevalence of
    off-axis jets in TDEs, and motivates systematic, long-term
    monitoring of these unique transients. The brightest objects in our
    sample are also detected in the VLA Sky Survey (VLASS),
    demonstrating that all-sky radio surveys can play an important role
    in discovering unexpected radio properties of the TDE population.}

  abstract = {The upcoming Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST)
    conducted by the Vera C. Rubin Observatory will detect millions of
    supernovae (SNe) and generate millions of nightly alerts, far
    outpacing available spectroscopic resources. Rapid, scalable
    photometric classification methods are therefore essential for
    identifying young SNe for follow-up and enabling large-scale
    population studies. We present SPLASH, a host-based classification
    pipeline that infers supernova classes using only host galaxy
    photometry. SPLASH first associates SNe with their hosts (yielding a
    redshift estimate), then infers host galaxy stellar mass and star
    formation rate using deep learning, and finally classifies SNe using
    a random forest trained on these inferred properties, along with
    host-SN angular separation and redshift. SPLASH achieves a binary
    (Type Ia vs. core-collapse) classification accuracy of
    \$76{\textbackslash{}}\%\$ and an F1-score of
    \$69{\textbackslash{}}\%\$, comparable to other state-of-the-art
    methods. By selecting only the most confident predictions, SPLASH
    can return highly pure subsets of all major SN types, making it
    well-suited for targeted follow-up. Its efficient design allows
    classification of \${\textbackslash{}}sim 500\$ SNe per second,
    making it ideal for next-generation surveys. Moreover, its
    intermediate inference step enables selection of transients by host
    environment, providing a tool not only for classification but also
    for probing the demographics of stellar death.}

    have become necessary to utilize the full potential of large samples
    of observations obtained from wide-field photometric surveys, such
    as the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) and the Vera C. Rubin
    Observatory. Here, we present a photometric classifier for SN light
    curves that does not rely on redshift information and still
    maintains comparable accuracy to redshift-dependent classifiers. Our
    new package, Superphot+, uses a parametric model to extract
    meaningful features from multiband SN light curves. We train a
    gradient-boosted machine with fit parameters from 6061 ZTF SNe that
    pass data quality cuts and are spectroscopically classified as one
    of five classes: SN Ia, SN II, SN Ib/c, SN IIn, and SLSN-I. Without
    redshift information, our classifier yields a class-averaged F
    1-score of 0.61 ± 0.02 and a total accuracy of 0.83 ± 0.01.
    Including redshift information improves these metrics to 0.71 ± 0.02
    and 0.88 ± 0.01, respectively. We assign new class probabilities to
    3558 ZTF transients that show SN-like characteristics (based on the
    ALeRCE Broker light-curve and stamp classifiers) but lack
    spectroscopic classifications. Finally, we compare our predicted SN
    labels with those generated by the ALeRCE light-curve classifier,
    finding that the two classifiers agree on photometric labels for
    82\% ± 2\% of light curves with spectroscopic labels and 72\% ± 0\%
    of light curves without spectroscopic labels. Superphot+ is
    currently classifying ZTF SNe in real time via the ANTARES Broker,

    imaging data (Stripe 82), we have searched for the tidal disruption
    of stars by supermassive black holes in non-active galaxies. Two
    candidate tidal disruption events (TDEs) are identified. The TDE
    flares have optical blackbody temperatures of 2 × 104 K and observed
    peak luminosities of Mg = -18.3 and -20.4 (νL ν = 5 × 1042, 4 × 1043
    erg s-1, in the rest frame); their cooling rates are very low,
    qualitatively consistent with expectations for tidal disruption
    flares. The properties of the TDE candidates are examined using (1)
    SDSS imaging to compare them to other flares observed in the search,
    (2) UV emission measured by GALEX, and (3) spectra of the hosts and
    of one of the flares. Our pipeline excludes optically identifiable
    AGN hosts, and our variability monitoring over nine years provides
    strong evidence that these are not flares in hidden AGNs. The
    spectra and color evolution of the flares are unlike any SN observed
    to date, their strong late-time UV emission is particularly
    distinctive, and they are nuclear at high resolution arguing against
    these being first cases of a previously unobserved class of SNe or
    more extreme examples of known SN types. Taken together, the
    observed properties are difficult to reconcile with an SN or an
    AGN-flare explanation, although an entirely new process specific to
    the inner few hundred parsecs of non-active galaxies cannot be
    excluded. Based on our observed rate, we infer that hundreds or
    thousands of TDEs will be present in current and next-generation
    optical synoptic surveys. Using the approach outlined here, a TDE
    candidate sample with O(1) purity can be selected using geometric
    resolution and host and flare color alone, demonstrating that a
    campaign to create a large sample of TDEs, with immediate and
    detailed multi-wavelength follow-up, is feasible. A by-product of
    this work is quantification of the power spectrum of extreme flares

    transients, most notably the class of hydrogen-poor superluminous

    we present a machine-learning classification algorithm targeted at
    rapid identification of a pure sample of SLSN-I to enable

    of the Finding Luminous and Exotic Extragalactic Transients (FLEET)

    Additionally, we present two alternative classifiers that use either

  abstract = {GRB 221009A (z = 0.151) is one of the closest known long
    γ-ray bursts (GRBs). Its extreme brightness across all
    electromagnetic wavelengths provides an unprecedented opportunity to
    study a member of this still-mysterious class of transients in
    exquisite detail. We present multiwavelength observations of this
    extraordinary event, spanning 15 orders of magnitude in photon
    energy from radio to γ-rays. We find that the data can be partially
    explained by a forward shock (FS) from a highly collimated
    relativistic jet interacting with a low-density, wind-like medium.
    Under this model, the jet’s beaming-corrected kinetic energy (E K
    {\textasciitilde{}} 4 × 1050 erg) is typical for the GRB population.
    The radio and millimeter data provide strong limiting constraints on
    the FS model, but require the presence of an additional emission
    component. From equipartition arguments, we find that the radio
    emission is likely produced by a small amount of mass (≲6 × 10-7 M
    ⊙) moving relativistically (Γ ≳ 9) with a large kinetic energy
    (≳1049 erg). However, the temporal evolution of this component does
    not follow prescriptions for synchrotron radiation from a single
    power-law distribution of electrons (e.g., in a reverse shock or

    suggesting that one of the standard assumptions of afterglow theory
    is violated. GRB 221009A will likely remain detectable with radio

    track the full lifecycle of a powerful relativistic jet.}

  abstract = {We present continued radio and X-ray observations of the
    relativistic tidal disruption event Swift J164449.3+573451 extending
    to δt ≈ 2000 days after discovery. The radio data were obtained with
    the Very Large Array (VLA) as part of a long-term program to monitor
    the energy and dynamical evolution of the jet and to characterize
    the parsec-scale environment around a previously dormant
    supermassive black hole. We combine these data with Chandra
    observations and demonstrate that the X-ray emission following the
    sharp decline at δt ≈ 500 days is likely due to the forward shock.
    We constrain the synchrotron cooling frequency and the microphysical
    properties of the outflow for the first time. We find that the
    cooling frequency evolves through the optical/NIR band at δt ≈
    10-200 days, corresponding to ɛ B ≈ 10-3, well below equipartition;
    the X-ray data demonstrate that this deviation from equipartition
    holds to at least δt ≈ 2000 days. We thus recalculate the physical
    properties of the jet over the lifetime of the event, no longer
    assuming equipartition. We find a total kinetic energy of E K ≈ 4 ×
    1051 erg and a transition to non-relativistic expansion on the
    timescale of our latest observations (700 days). The density profile
    is approximately R -3/2 at ≲0.3 pc and ≳0.7 pc, with a plateau at
    intermediate scales, characteristic of Bondi accretion. Based on its
    evolution thus far, we predict that Sw 1644+57 will be detectable at
    centimeter wavelengths for decades to centuries with existing and
    upcoming radio facilities. Similar off-axis events should be
    detectable to z ∼ 2, but with a slow evolution that may inhibit
    their recognition as transient events.}

    Australia Telescope Compact Array, the Atacama Large
    Millimeter/submillimeter Array, and the MeerKAT radio telescopes,
    spanning 40–1464 days after the onset of the optical flare. We find
    that ASASSN-19bt displays unusual radio evolution compared to other
    TDEs, as the peak brightness of its radio emission increases rapidly
    until 457 days post-optical discovery and then plateaus. Using a
    generalized approach to standard equipartition techniques, we
    estimate the energy and corresponding physical parameters for two
    possible emission geometries: a nonrelativistic spherical outflow
    and a relativistic outflow observed from a range of viewing angles.
    We find that the nonrelativistic solution implies a continuous
    energy rise in the outflow from E ∼ 1046 to E ∼ 1049 erg with
    outflow speed β ≈ 0.05, while the off-axis relativistic jet solution
    instead suggests E ≈ 1052 erg with Lorentz factor Γ ∼ 10 at late
    times in the maximally off-axis case. We find that neither model
    provides a holistic explanation for the origin and evolution of the
    radio emission, emphasizing the need for more complex models.
    ASASSN-19bt joins the population of TDEs that display unusual radio
    emission at late times. Conducting long-term radio observations of
    these TDEs, especially during the later phases, will be crucial for
    understanding how these types of radio emission in TDEs are
    produced.}

    characterized by broad (∼104 km s−1) emission lines and show a large
    diversity as well as different line profiles. After carefully and
    consistently performing a series of data reduction tasks including
    host galaxy light subtraction, we present here the first detailed,
    spectroscopic population study of 16 optical and UV TDEs. We study a
    number of emission lines prominent among TDEs including Hydrogen,
    Helium, and Bowen lines and we quantify their evolution with time in
    terms of line luminosities, velocity widths, and velocity offsets.
    We report a time lag between the peaks of the optical light curves
    and the peak luminosity of Hα spanning between ∼7 and 45 days. If
    interpreted as light echoes, these lags correspond to distances of
    ∼2 − 12 × 1016 cm, which are one to two orders of magnitudes larger
    than the estimated blackbody radii (RBB) of the same TDEs and we
    discuss the possible origin of this surprisingly large discrepancy.
    We also report time lags for the peak luminosity of the He I 5876 Å
    line, which are smaller than the ones of Hα for H TDEs and similar
    or larger for N III Bowen TDEs. We report that N III Bowen TDEs have
    lower Hα velocity widths compared to the rest of the TDEs in our
    sample and we also find that a strong X-ray to optical ratio might
    imply weakening of the line widths. Furthermore, we study the
    evolution of line luminosities and ratios with respect to their
    radii (RBB) and temperatures (TBB). We find a linear relationship
    between Hα luminosity and the RBB (Lline ∝ RBB) and potentially an
    inverse power-law relation with TBB (Lline ∝ TBB−β), leading to
    weaker Hα emission for TBB ≥ 25 000 K. The He II/He I ratio becomes
    large at the same temperatures, possibly pointing to an ionization
    effect. The He II/Hα ratio becomes larger as the photospheric radius
    recedes, implying a stratified photosphere where Helium lies deeper
    than Hydrogen. We suggest that the large diversity of the
    spectroscopic features seen in TDEs along with their X-ray
    properties can potentially be attributed to viewing angle effects.}

    defined by randomly chosen impact factors and SMBH masses drawn from
    six different mass distributions. Observations of TDEs over 10 years
    of LSST operation were simulated by querying the simulated observing
    strategy database minion\_1016. Based on the results of our
    simulations, we estimate that the LSST should discover between
    35,000 and 80,000 TDEs in 10 years of operation, depending on the
    assumed SMBH mass distribution. We also find that probing the SMBH
    mass distribution with TDE observations will not be straightforward,
    due to the fact that TDEs caused by low-mass black holes (105M⊙) are
    expected to be less luminous and shorter than TDEs by heavier SMBHs
    ({\textgreater{}} 106M⊙), and therefore will mostly be missed by the

    relativistic jet or externally by shocks resulting from an outflow
    interacting with the circumnuclear medium. Until now, evidence for
    the internal emission mechanism has been lacking; nearly all tidal
    disruption flare studies have adopted the external shock model to
    explain the observed properties of radio flares. Here we report a
    result that presents a challenge to external emission models: we
    discovered a cross-correlation between the soft X-ray (0.3-1 keV)
    and 16 GHz radio flux of the tidal disruption flare ASASSN-14li.
    Variability features in the X-ray light curve appear again in the
    radio light curve, but after a time lag of \{12\}-5+6 days. This
    demonstrates that the soft X-ray-emitting accretion disk regulates
    the radio emission. This coupling appears to be inconsistent with
    all previous external emission models for this source but is
    naturally explained if the radio emission originates from a freely
    expanding jet. We show that emission internal to an adiabatically
    expanding jet can also reproduce the observed evolution of the radio
    spectral energy distribution. Furthermore, both the correlation
    between X-ray and radio luminosity as well as our radio spectral
    modeling imply an approximately linear coupling between the

    shows that the X-ray source has faded back to its levels during the

    that the X-ray emission could be coming from delayed accretion
    through a newly forming debris disk and that the prompt UV/optical
    emission is from the prior circularization of the disk through
    stream-stream collisions. The lack of spectral evolution during the
    X-ray brightening disfavors ionization breakout of a TDE “veiled” by
    obscuring material. This is the first time a TDE has been shown to
    have a delayed peak in soft X-rays relative to the UV/optical peak,
    which may be the first clear signature of the real-time assembly of
    a nascent accretion disk, and provides strong evidence for the

    2010ma observed by GROND exhibit 0.80, 1.15, and 1.78 times the
    optical (r’-band) luminosity of SN 1998bw, respectively. While SN
    2009nz exhibits an evolution similar to SN 1998bw, SNe 2008hw and
    2010ma show earlier peak times. The quasi-bolometric light curves
    (340-2200 nm) confirm the large luminosity of SN 2010ma (1.4 × 1043
    erg s-1), while SNe 2008hw and 2009nz reached a peak luminosity
    closer to that of SN 1998bw. The modelling indicates in 56Ni masses
    of around 0.4-0.5 M⊙. Conclusions: By means of a very comprehensive
    data set, we found that the luminosity and the 56Ni mass of SNe
    2008hw, 2009nz, and 2010ma resembles those of other known
    GRB-associated SNe. These findings strengthens previous claims of
    GRB-SNe being brighter than stripped-envelope SNe unaccompanied by
    GRBs. Appendices are available in electronic form at

  abstract = {Photometric classification of supernovae (SNe) is
    imperative as recent and upcoming optical time-domain surveys, such
    as the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST), overwhelm the
    available resources for spectrosopic follow-up. Here we develop a
    range of light curve (LC) classification pipelines, trained on 513
    spectroscopically classified SNe from the Pan-STARRS1 Medium-Deep
    Survey (PS1-MDS): 357 Type Ia, 93 Type II, 25 Type IIn, 21 Type Ibc,
    and 17 Type I superluminous SNe (SLSNe). We present a new parametric
    analytical model that can accommodate a broad range of SN LC
    morphologies, including those with a plateau, and fit this model to
    data in four PS1 filters (g P1 r P1 i P1 z P1). We test a number of
    feature extraction methods, data augmentation strategies, and
    machine-learning algorithms to predict the class of each SN. Our
    best pipelines result in ≈90\% average accuracy, ≈70\% average
    purity, and ≈80\% average completeness for all SN classes, with the
    highest success rates for SNe Ia and SLSNe and the lowest for SNe
    Ibc. Despite the greater complexity of our classification scheme,
    the purity of our SN Ia classification, ≈95\%, is on par with
    methods developed specifically for Type Ia versus non-Type Ia binary
    classification. As the first of its kind, this study serves as a
    guide to developing and training classification algorithms for a
    wide range of SN types with a purely empirical training set,
    particularly one that is similar in its characteristics to the
    expected LSST main survey strategy. Future work will implement this
    classification pipeline on ≈3000 PS1/MDS LCs that lack spectroscopic
    classification.}

  abstract = {Automated classification of supernovae (SNe) based on
    optical photometric light-curve information is essential in the
    upcoming era of wide-field time domain surveys, such as the Legacy
    Survey of Space and Time (LSST) conducted by the Rubin Observatory.
    Photometric classification can enable real-time identification of
    interesting events for extended multiwavelength follow-up, as well
    as archival population studies. Here we present the complete sample
    of 5243 "SN-like" light curves (in gP1rP1iP1zP1) from the
    Pan-STARRS1 Medium-Deep Survey (PS1-MDS). The PS1-MDS is similar to
    the planned LSST Wide-Fast-Deep survey in terms of cadence, filters,
    and depth, making this a useful training set for the community.
    Using this data set, we train a novel semisupervised machine
    learning algorithm to photometrically classify 2315 new SN-like
    light curves with host galaxy spectroscopic redshifts. Our algorithm
    consists of an RF supervised classification step and a novel
    unsupervised step in which we introduce a recurrent autoencoder
    neural network (RAENN). Our final pipeline, dubbed SuperRAENN, has
    an accuracy of 87\% across five SN classes (Type Ia, Ibc, II, IIn,
    SLSN-I) and macro-averaged purity and completeness of 66\% and 69\%,
    respectively. We find the highest accuracy rates for SNe Ia and
    SLSNe and the lowest for SNe Ibc. Our complete spectroscopically and
    photometrically classified samples break down into 62.0\% Type Ia
    (1839 objects), 19.8\% Type II (553 objects), 4.8\% Type IIn (136
    objects), 11.7\% Type Ibc (291 objects), and 1.6\% Type I SLSNe (54

    such as the upcoming Vera C. Rubin Observatory and its associated
    Legacy Survey of Space and Time. From the haystack of potential
    science targets, astronomers must allocate scarce resources to study
    a selection of needles in real time. Here we present a variational
    recurrent autoencoder neural network to encode simulated Rubin
    Observatory extragalactic transient events using 1\% of the PLAsTiCC
    data set to train the autoencoder. Our unsupervised method uniquely
    works with unlabeled, real-time, multivariate, and aperiodic data.
    We rank 1,129,184 events based on an anomaly score estimated using
    an isolation forest. We find that our pipeline successfully ranks
    rarer classes of transients as more anomalous. Using simple cuts in
    anomaly score and uncertainty, we identify a pure (≈95\% pure)
    sample of rare transients (i.e., transients other than Type Ia, Type
    II, and Type Ibc supernovae), including superluminous and
    pair-instability supernovae. Finally, our algorithm is able to
    identify these transients as anomalous well before peak, enabling
    real-time follow-up studies in the era of the Rubin Observatory.}
