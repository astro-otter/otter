	abstract = {We present a toy model for the thermal optical/UV/X-ray emission from tidal disruption events (TDEs). Motivated by recent hydrodynamical simulations, we assume that the debris streams promptly and rapidly circularize (on the orbital period of the most tightly bound debris), generating a hot quasi-spherical pressure-supported envelope of radius R v ∼ 1014 cm (photosphere radius ∼1015 cm) surrounding the supermassive black hole (SMBH). As the envelope cools radiatively, it undergoes Kelvin–Helmholtz contraction R v ∝ t −1, its temperature rising T eff ∝ t 1/2 while its total luminosity remains roughly constant; the optical luminosity decays as . Despite this similarity to the mass fallback rate , envelope heating from fallback accretion is subdominant compared to the envelope cooling luminosity except near optical peak (where they are comparable). Envelope contraction can be delayed by energy injection from accretion from the inner envelope onto the SMBH in a regulated manner, leading to a late-time flattening of the optical/X-ray light curves, similar to those observed in some TDEs. Eventually, as the envelope contracts to near the circularization radius, the SMBH accretion rate rises to its maximum, in tandem with the decreasing optical luminosity. This cooling-induced (rather than circularization-induced) delay of up to several hundred days may account for the delayed onset of thermal X-rays, late-time radio flares, and high-energy neutrino generation, observed in some TDEs. We compare the model predictions to recent TDE light-curve correlation studies, finding both agreement and points of tension.},

	abstract = {In the past few years wide-field optical and UV transient surveys and X-ray telescopes have allowed us to identify a few dozen candidate tidal disruption events (TDEs). While in theory the physical processes in TDEs are ubiquitous, a few distinct classes of TDEs have been observed. Some TDEs radiate mainly in NUV/optical, while others produce prominent X-rays. Moreover, relativistic jets have been observed in only a handful of TDEs. This diversity might be related to the details of the super-Eddington accretion and emission physics relevant to TDE disks. In this Letter, we utilize novel three-dimensional general relativistic radiation magnetohydrodynamics simulations to study the super-Eddington compact disk phase expected in TDEs. Consistent with previous studies, geometrically thick disks, wide-angle optically thick fast outflows, and relativistic jets are produced. The outflow density and velocity depend sensitively on the inclination angle, and hence so does the reprocessing of emission produced from the inner disk. We then use Monte Carlo radiative transfer to calculate the reprocessed spectra and find that that the observed ratio of optical to X-ray fluxes increases with increasing inclination angle. This naturally leads to a unified model for different classes of TDEs in which the spectral properties of the TDE depend mainly on the viewing angle of the observer with respect to the orientation of the disk.},

	abstract = {A tidal disruption event (TDE) takes place when a star passes near enough to a massive black hole to be disrupted. About half the star’s matter is given elliptical trajectories with large apocenter distances, and the other half is unbound. To form an accretion flow, the bound matter must lose a significant amount of energy, with the actual amount depending on the characteristic scale of the flow measured in units of the black hole’s gravitational radius ( erg). Recent numerical simulations have revealed that the accretion flow scale is close to the scale of the most bound initial orbits, cm from the black hole, and the corresponding energy dissipation rate is erg s−1. We suggest that the energy liberated during the formation of the accretion disk, rather than the energy liberated by subsequent accretion onto the black hole, powers the observed optical TDE candidates. The observed rise times, luminosities, temperatures, emission radii, and line widths seen in these TDEs are all more readily explained in terms of heating associated with disk formation rather than in terms of accretion.},

We explore the properties of these candidates, using nearly three decades of X-ray observations to quantify their properties and characteristics. We ﬁnd that the emission from X-ray TDEs increase by two to three orders of magnitude, compared to pre-ﬂare constraints. These emissions evolve signiﬁcantly with time, and decay with power-law indices that are typically shallower than the canonical t−5/3 decay law, implying that X-ray TDEs are viscously delayed. These events exhibit enhanced (relative to galactic) column densities and are quite soft in nature, with no strong correlation between the amount of detected soft and hard emission. At their peak, jetted events have an X-ray to optical ratio ?1, whereas non-jetted events have a ratio ∼1, which suggests that these events undergo reprocessing at different rates. X-ray TDEs have long T90 values, consistent with what would be expected from a viscously driven accretion disk formed by the disruption of a main-sequence star by a black hole with a mass {\textless}107 Me. The isotropic luminosities of X-ray TDEs are bimodal, such that jetted and non-jetted events are separated by a “reprocessing valley” that we suggest is naturally populated by optical/UV TDEs that most likely produce X-rays, but this emission is “veiled” from observations due to reprocessing. Our results suggest that non-jetted X-ray TDEs likely originate from partial disruptions and/or disruptions of low-mass stars.},

              We present a systematic analysis of the X-ray emission of a sample of 17 optically selected, X-ray-detected tidal disruption events (TDEs) discovered between 2014 and 2021. The X-ray light curves show a diverse range of temporal behaviors, with most sources not following the expected power-law decline. The X-ray spectra are mostly extremely soft and consistent with thermal emission from the innermost region of an accretion disk, which cools as the accretion rate decreases. Three sources show formation of a hard X-ray corona at late times. The spectral energy distribution shape, probed by the ratio (

	abstract = {Tidal disruption events (TDEs) occur when a star gets torn apart by a supermassive black hole as it crosses its tidal radius. We present late-time optical and X-ray observations of the nuclear transient AT2019qiz, which showed the typical signs of an optical-UV transient class commonly believed to be TDEs. Optical spectra were obtained 428, 481, and 828 rest-frame days after optical light-curve peak, and a UV/X-ray observation coincided with the later spectrum. The optical spectra show strong coronal emission lines, including [Fe VII], [Fe X], [Fe XI], and [Fe XIV]. The Fe lines rise and then fall, except [Fe XIV] that appears late and rises. We observe increasing flux of narrow H α and H β and a decrease in broad H α flux. The coronal lines have full width at half-maximum ranging from {\textasciitilde}150-300 km s-1, suggesting they originate from a region between the broad- and narrow-line emitting gas. Between the optical flare and late-time observation, the X-ray spectrum softens dramatically. The 0.3-1 keV X-ray flux increases by a factor of {\textasciitilde}50, while the hard X-ray flux decreases by a factor of {\textasciitilde}6. Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer fluxes also rose over the same period, indicating the presence of an infrared echo. With AT2017gge, AT2019qiz is one of two examples of a spectroscopically confirmed optical-UV TDE showing delayed coronal line emission, supporting speculations that Extreme Coronal Line Emitters in quiescent galaxies can be echos of unobserved past TDEs. We argue that the coronal lines, narrow lines, and infrared emission arise from the illumination of pre-existing material likely related to either a previous TDE or active galactic nucleus activity.},

In a previous paper, we presented the first sample of radio-selected, optically-detected TDEs, which included two events (VT J1008 and VT J2012) associated with late-time (\$\{{\textbackslash}sim\}2\$ years post-optical flare) intermediate with emission lines that are largely unprecedented from TDEs. In this paper, we investigate these two events in detail. The multiwavelength properties of these events are otherwise consistent with optically-selected TDEs. They are hosted by green valley, E+A/Balmer dominated galaxies with low star formation rates and black holes masses \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm BH\}{\textbackslash}approx 10{\textasciicircum}\{5-6\}{\textbackslash},M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$. The optical flare shapes are fully consistent with those of optically-selected TDEs, although they are slightly faint and cool at peak. The radio emission from both events is consistent with wide-angle, non-relativistic outflows with \$L\_R(\{{\textbackslash}rm GHz\}) {\textbackslash}sim 10{\textasciicircum}\{38\}\$ erg s\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$. Balmer and Helium emission lines are detected from both events with full-width-half-maxima \$\{{\textbackslash}sim\}700\$ km s\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ and asymmetric line profiles. VT J1008 additionally shows coronal line emission with a similar width. The lines from VT J2012 are redshifted by \$\{{\textbackslash}sim\}700\$ km s\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ relative to the host galaxy. We show that these events share many characteristics in common with the ambiguous class of extreme coronal line emitters. We argue that the lines are likely associated with a radiative shock or dense, photoionized clumps of outflowing gas in the circumnuclear medium.},

	abstract = {Tidal disruption events (TDEs) occur when a star enters the tidal radius of a supermassive black hole (SMBH). If the star only grazes the tidal radius, a fraction of the stellar mass will be accreted in a partial TDE (pTDE). The remainder can continue orbiting and may re-disrupted at pericenter, causing a repeating pTDE. pTDEs may be as or more common than full TDEs (fTDEs), yet few are known. In this work, we present the discovery of the first repeating pTDE from a systematically-selected sample, AT{\textbackslash},2020vdq. AT{\textbackslash},2020vdq was originally identified as an optically- and radio-flaring TDE. Around \$3\$ years after its discovery, it rebrightened dramatically and rapidly in the optical. The optical flare was remarkably fast and luminous compared to previous TDEs. It was accompanied by extremely broad (\$\{{\textbackslash}sim\}0.1c\$) optical/UV spectral features and faint X-ray emission (\$L\_X {\textbackslash}sim 3{\textbackslash}times10{\textasciicircum}\{41\}\${\textbackslash},erg{\textbackslash},s\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$), but no new radio-emitting component. Based on the transient optical/UV spectral features and the broadband light curve, we show that AT{\textbackslash},2020vdq is a repeating pTDE. We then use it to constrain TDE models; in particular, we favor a star originally in a very tight binary system that is tidally broken apart by the Hills mechanism. We also constrain the repeating pTDE rate to be \$10{\textasciicircum}\{-6\}\$ to \$10{\textasciicircum}\{-5\}\$ yr\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ galaxy\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$, with uncertainties dominated by the unknown distribution of pTDE repeat timescales. In the Hills framework, this means the binary fraction in the galactic nucleus is of the order few percent.},

	abstract = {A dormant supermassive black hole lurking in the center of a galaxy will be revealed when a star passes close enough to be torn apart by tidal forces, and a flare of electromagnetic radiation is emitted when the bound fraction of the stellar debris falls back onto the black hole and is accreted. Although the tidal disruption of a star is a rare event in a galaxy, ≈10−4 yr−1, observational candidates have emerged in all-sky X-ray and deep ultraviolet (UV) surveys in the form of luminous UV/X-ray flares from otherwise quiescent galaxies. Here we present the third candidate tidal disruption event discovered in the Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX) Deep Imaging Survey: a 1.6 × 1043 erg s−1 UV/optical flare from a star-forming galaxy at z = 0.1855. The UV/optical spectral energy distribution (SED) during the peak of the flare measured by GALEX and Palomar Large Field Camera imaging can be modeled as a single temperature blackbody with Tbb = 1.7 × 105 K and a bolometric luminosity of 3 × 1045 erg s−1, assuming an internal extinction with E(B − V)gas = 0.3. The Chandra upper limit on the X-ray luminosity during the peak of the flare, LX(2 − 10 keV){\textless}1041 erg s−1, is 2 orders of magnitude fainter than expected from the ratios of UV to X-ray flux density observed in active galaxies. We compare the light curves and broadband properties of all three tidal disruption candidates discovered by GALEX, and find that (1) the light curves are well fitted by the power-law decline expected for the fallback of debris from a tidally disrupted solar-type star and (2) the UV/optical SEDs can be attributed to thermal emission from an envelope of debris located at roughly 10 times the tidal disruption radius of a ≈107M☉ central black hole. We use the observed peak absolute optical magnitudes of the flares (−17.5{\textgreater}Mg {\textgreater} − 18.9) to predict the detection capabilities of upcoming optical synoptic surveys.},

	abstract = {A tidal disruption event (TDE) occurs when a star plunges through a supermassive black hole's tidal radius, at which point the star's self-gravity is overwhelmed by the tidal gravity of the black hole. In a partial TDE, where the star does not reach the full disruption radius, only a fraction of the star's mass is tidally stripped while the rest remains intact in the form of a surviving core. Analytical arguments have recently suggested that the temporal scaling of the fallback rate of debris to the black hole asymptotes to \$t{\textasciicircum}\{-9/4\}\$ for partial disruptions, effectively independently of the mass of the intact core. We present hydrodynamical simulations that verify the existence of this predicted, \$t{\textasciicircum}\{-9/4\}\$ scaling. We also define a break timescale -- the time at which the fallback rate transitions from a \$t{\textasciicircum}\{-5/3\}\$ scaling to the characteristic \$t{\textasciicircum}\{-9/4\}\$ scaling -- and measure this break timescale as a function of the impact parameter and the surviving core mass. These results deepen our understanding of the properties and breadth of possible fallback curves expected from TDEs and will therefore facilitate more accurate interpretation of data from wide-field surveys.},

The EELR requires a nonstellar ionizing continuum with a luminosity erg s‑1, inconsistent with the current weak state (L IR,AGN {\textless} 2.5 × 1042 erg s‑1) of the galactic nucleus. The ionized gas has low velocity (∼–50 km s‑1) and low turbulence (σ gas ≲ 50 km s‑1) and is kinematically decoupled from the stellar motions, indicating that the gas kinematics is not active galactic nucleus (AGN) driven. Markarian 950 is the third PSB galaxy to host a weak nuclear ionizing source as well as an EELR and a TDE. The overall properties of these three galaxies, including the kinematics and accretion history, are unusual but strikingly similar. We estimate that the incidence of EELRs in PSB-TDE hosts is a factor of ∼10 × higher than in other PSB galaxies. This suggests that a gas-rich postmerger environment is a key ingredient in driving elevated TDE rates. Based on the current observations, we cannot rule out that the EELRs may be powered through an elevated TDE rate in these galaxies. If the EELRs are not TDE powered, the presence of intermittent AGN activity, and in particular the fading of the AGN, may be associated with an increased TDE rate and/or an increased rate of detecting TDEs.},

	abstract = {We present a comprehensive study to measure the locations of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) relative to their host galaxies. In total, we find the offsets of 20 long-duration GRBs from their apparent host galaxy centers by utilizing ground-based images from Palomar and Keck and space-based images from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). We discuss in detail how a host galaxy is assigned to an individual GRB and the robustness of the assignment process. The median projected angular (physical) offset is 0.17" (1.3 kpc). The median offset normalized by the individual host half-light radii is 0.98, suggesting a strong connection of GRB locations with the UV light of their hosts. This provides strong observational evidence for the connection of GRBs to star formation. We further compare the observed offset distribution with the predicted burst locations of leading stellar-mass progenitor models. In particular, we compare the observed offset distribution with an exponential disk, a model for the location of collapsars and promptly bursting binaries (e.g., helium star-black hole binaries). The statistical comparison shows good agreement, given the simplicity of the model, with the Kolmogorov-Smirnov probability that the observed offsets derive from the model distribution of PKS=0.45. We also compare the observed GRB offsets with the expected offset distribution of delayed merging remnant progenitors (black hole-neutron star and neutron star-neutron star binaries). We find that delayed merging remnant progenitors, insofar as the predicted offset distributions from population synthesis studies are representative, can be ruled out at the 2×10-3 level. This is arguably the strongest observational constraint yet against delayed merging remnants as the progenitors of long-duration GRBs. In the course of this study, we have also discovered the putative host galaxies of GRB 990510 and GRB 990308 in archival HST data.

	abstract = {Most tidal disruption events (TDEs) are currently found in time-domain optical and soft X-ray surveys, both of which are prone to significant obscuration. The infrared (IR), however, is a powerful probe of dust-enshrouded environments; hence, we recently performed a systematic search of NEOWISE mid-IR data for nearby, obscured TDEs within roughly 200 Mpc. We identified 18 TDE candidates in galactic nuclei, using difference imaging to uncover nuclear variability among significant host galaxy emission. These candidates were selected based on the following IR light-curve properties: (1) L W2 ≳ 1042 erg s‑1 at peak; (2) fast rise, followed by a slow, monotonic decline; (3) no significant prior variability; and (4) no evidence for active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity in Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) colors. The majority of these sources showed no variable optical counterpart, suggesting that optical surveys indeed miss numerous obscured TDEs. Using narrow-line ionization levels and variability arguments, we identified six sources as possible underlying AGN, yielding a total of 12 TDEs in our gold sample. This gold sample yields a lower limit on the IR-selected TDE rate of (2.0 ± 0.3) × 10‑5 galaxy‑1 yr‑1 ((1.3 ± 0.2) × 10‑7 Mpc‑3 yr‑1), which is comparable to optical and X-ray TDE rates. The IR-selected TDE host galaxies do not show a green valley overdensity nor as a preference for quiescent, Balmer strong galaxies, which are both overrepresented in optical and X-ray TDE samples. This IR-selected sample represents a new population of dusty TDEs that have historically been missed by optical and X-ray surveys and helps alleviate tensions between observed and theoretical TDE rates and the so-called missing energy problem.},

	abstract = {Some galaxies show little to no sign of active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity, yet exhibit strong coronal line (CL) emission relative to common narrow emission lines. Many of these CLs have ionization potentials of ≥100 eV, thus requiring strong extreme ultraviolet and/or soft X-ray flux. It has long been thought that such events are powered by tidal disruption events (TDEs), but owing to a lack of detailed multiwavelength follow-up, such a connection has not been firmly made. Here, we compare coronal line emitters (CLEs) and TDEs in terms of their host-galaxy and transient properties. We find that the mid-infrared (MIR) colours of CLE hosts in quiescence are similar to those of TDE hosts. Additionally, many CLEs show evidence of a large dust reprocessing echo in their MIR colours, a sign of significant dust in the nucleus. The stellar masses and star formation rates of the CLE hosts are largely consistent with TDE hosts, with many CLEs residing within the green valley. The blackbody properties of CLEs and TDEs are similar, with some CLEs showing hot (T ≥ 40 000 K) blackbody temperatures. Finally, the location of CLEs on the peak-luminosity/decline-rate parameter space is much closer to TDEs than many other major classes of nuclear transients. Combined, these provide strong evidence to confirm the previous claims that CLEs are indeed TDEs in gas-rich environments. We additionally propose a stricter threshold of CL flux ≥1/3 × [O III] flux to better exclude AGNs from the sample of CLEs.},

	abstract = {Extreme coronal line emitters (ECLEs) are objects showing transient high-ionization lines in the centers of galaxies. They have been attributed to echoes of high-energy flares of ionizing radiation, such as those produced by tidal disruption events (TDEs), but have only recently been observed within hundreds of days after an optical transient was detected. AT 2022upj is a nuclear UV-optical flare at z=0.054 with spectra showing [Fe X] \{{\textbackslash}lambda\}6375 and [Fe XIV] \{{\textbackslash}lambda\}5303 during the optical peak, the earliest presence of extreme coronal lines during an ongoing transient. AT 2022upj is also the second ever ECLE (and first with a concurrent flare) to show broad He II \{{\textbackslash}lambda\}4686 emission, a key signature of optical/UV TDEs. We also detect X-ray emission during the optical transient phase, which may be related to the source of ionizing photons for the extreme coronal lines. Finally, we analyze the spectroscopic evolution of each emission line and find that [Fe X] and [Fe XIV] weaken within 400d of optical peak, while [Fe VII] \{{\textbackslash}lambda\}5720, [Fe VII] \{{\textbackslash}lambda\}6087, and [O III] \{{\textbackslash}lambda\}\{{\textbackslash}lambda\}4959,5007 emerge over the same period. The velocities of the iron lines indicate circumnuclear gas within 0.1pc of the central supermassive black hole (SMBH), while a dust echo inferred from NEOWISE data indicates that circumnuclear dust lies at a minimum of 0.4pc away, providing evidence of stratified material around a SMBH. AT 2022upj is the first confirmed ECLE-TDE with clear signatures of both classes. This event's spectroscopic evolution on a \${\textbackslash}sim\$year unveils the impact of highly energetic flares such as TDEs on the complex environments around SMBHs.},

	abstract = {Synchrotron emission is ubiquitous in explosive astrophysical events -- it is a natural byproduct of shocks formed when matter expelled by the explosion collides with ambient material. This emission is well-observed in various classes of transients, and is often interpreted within a canonical `equipartition' framework that allows physical properties of the shock to be inferred from the frequency and luminosity at which the observed spectral energy distribution (SED) peaks. This framework has been remarkably successful in explaining observations of radio supernovae. It has also been used for trans-relativistic explosions, where the shock velocities approach the speed of light. However, the conventional framework does not incorporate relativistic effects. Neither does it account for thermal electrons, which have been shown to be important for high-velocity shocks. In this paper we describe a revised framework that accounts for these two effects, and is applicable to non-relativistic, trans-relativistic, and ultra-relativistic explosions. We show that accounting for these effects can dramatically change the inferred parameters of high-velocity shocks, and in particular -- that the shock velocity, ambient density, and total energy are overestimated by the conventional non-relativistic framework. We delineate the phase-space where such modifications are important in terms of observationally measurable parameters. We also find a novel upper limit on the peak synchrotron luminosity of shock-powered transients, which is remarkably consistent with existing observations. Finally, we discuss a prediction of the model -- that the SED will qualitatively change as a function of shock velocity -- and show that this is broadly consistent with data for representative events (e.g., SN1998bw, AT2018cow, CSS161010, AT2020xnd).},

This lower limit is also a good estimate of the magnetic field and electrons' energy, if the two components are at equipartition. This well-known method was used for decades to study numerous astrophysical sources moving at non-relativistic (Newtonian) speeds. Here, we generalize the Newtonian equipartition theory to sources moving at relativistic speeds including the effect of deviation from spherical symmetry expected in such sources. As in the Newtonian case, minimization of the energy provides an excellent estimate of the emission radius and yields a useful lower limit on the energy. We find that the application of the Newtonian formalism to a relativistic source would yield a smaller emission radius, and would generally yield a larger lower limit on the energy (within the observed region). For sources where the synchrotron-self-Compton component can be identified, the minimization of the total energy is not necessary and we present an unambiguous solution for the parameters of the system.},

Full posterior distributions of the galaxy properties will be inferred using state-of-the-art Bayesian spectral energy distribution (SED) modeling of DESI spectroscopy and Legacy Surveys photometry. In this work, we present the SED model, the neural emulator for the model, and the Bayesian inference framework of PROVABGS. Furthermore, we apply the PROVABGS SED modeling on realistic synthetic DESI spectra and photometry, constructed using the L-GALAXIES semi-analytic model. We compare the inferred galaxy properties to the true values of the simulation using a hierarchical Bayesian framework to quantify accuracy and precision. Overall, we accurately infer the true M *, SFR, Z, and t age of the simulated galaxies. However, the priors on galaxy properties induced by the SED model have a significant impact on the posteriors, which we characterize in detail. This work also demonstrates that a joint analysis of spectra and photometry significantly improves the constraints on galaxy properties over photometry alone and is necessary to mitigate the impact of the priors. With the methodology presented and validated in this work, PROVABGS will maximize information extracted from DESI observations and extend current galaxy studies to new regimes and unlock cutting-edge probabilistic analyses. https://github.com/changhoonhahn/provabgs/},

Using follow-up spectra from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument and Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph, Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer mid-infrared observations, and Liverpool Telescope optical photometry, we find that of the seven new objects, only one evolves in a manner consistent with that of the five previously discovered variable ECLEs. Using this new sample of six variable ECLEs, we calculate the galaxy-normalised rate of ECLEs in SDSS to be \$R\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{G\}=2.2{\textasciitilde}{\textasciicircum}\{+1.3\}\_\{-0.8\}{\textasciitilde}({\textbackslash}mathrm\{statistical\}){\textasciitilde}{\textasciicircum}\{+0.0\}\_\{-1.3\}{\textasciitilde}({\textbackslash}mathrm\{systematic\}){\textbackslash}times10{\textasciicircum}\{-5\}{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}mathrm\{galaxy\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}mathrm\{year\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$. The mass-normalised rate is \$R\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{M\}=1.9{\textasciitilde}{\textasciicircum}\{+1.1\}\_\{-0.7\}{\textasciitilde}({\textbackslash}mathrm\{statistical\}){\textasciitilde}{\textasciicircum}\{+0.0\}\_\{-1.1\}{\textasciitilde}({\textbackslash}mathrm\{systematic\}){\textbackslash}times10{\textasciicircum}\{-16\}{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}mathrm\{M\_{\textbackslash}odot{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\}{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}mathrm\{year\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ and the volumetric rate is \$R\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{V\}=6.9{\textasciitilde}{\textasciicircum}\{+5.6\}\_\{-2.1\}{\textasciitilde}({\textbackslash}mathrm\{statistical\}){\textasciitilde}{\textasciicircum}\{+0.0\}\_\{-3.9\}{\textasciitilde}({\textbackslash}mathrm\{systematic\}){\textbackslash}times10{\textasciicircum}\{-8\}{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}mathrm\{Mpc\}{\textasciicircum}\{-3\}{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}mathrm\{year\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$. Our rates are comparable to TDE rates from the literature, supporting the suggestion that the CLs in variable ECLEs are the product of TDEs.},

To compare theoretical models with afterglow observations, we calculate here the broadband spectrum and corresponding light curve of synchrotron radiation from a power-law distribution of electrons in an expanding relativistic shock. Both the spectrum and the light curve consist of several power-law segments with related indices. The light curve is constructed under two limiting models for the hydrodynamic evolution of the shock: fully adiabatic and fully radiative. We give explicit relations between the spectral index and the temporal power-law index. Future observations should be able to distinguish between the possible behaviors and determine the type of solution.},

	abstract = {Gamma-ray burst afterglows are well described by synchrotron emission from relativistic blast waves expanding into an external medium. The blast wave is believed to amplify the magnetic ﬁeld and accelerate the electrons into a power-law distribution of energies promptly behind the shock. These electrons then cool both adiabatically and by emitting synchrotron and inverse Compton radiation. The resulting spectra are known to consist of several power-law segments, which smoothly join at certain break frequencies. Here, we give a complete description of all possible spectra under those assumptions and ﬁnd that there are ﬁve possible regimes, depending on the ordering of the break frequencies. The ﬂux density is calculated by integrating over all of the contributions to a given photon arrival time from all of the shocked region using the Blandford \& McKee solution. This allows us to calculate more accurate expressions for the value of these break frequencies and describe the shape of the spectral breaks around them. This also provides the shape of breaks in the light curves caused by the passage of a break frequency through the observed band. These new, more exact, estimates are diﬀerent from more simple calculations by typically a factor of a few, and they describe some new regimes that were previously ignored.},

While the number of observed TDEs has grown thanks to the emergence of wide-field surveys in the past few decades, questions regarding the nature of the observed optical, UV, and X-ray emission remain. We present a uniformly selected sample of 30 spectroscopically classified TDEs from the Zwicky Transient Facility Phase I survey operations with follow-up Swift UV and X-ray observations. Through our investigation into correlations between light-curve properties, we recover a shallow positive correlation between the peak bolometric luminosity and decay timescales. We introduce a new spectroscopic class of TDE, TDE-featureless, which are characterized by featureless optical spectra. The new TDE-featureless class shows larger peak bolometric luminosities, peak blackbody temperatures, and peak blackbody radii. We examine the differences between the X-ray bright and X-ray faint populations of TDEs in this sample, finding that X-ray bright TDEs show higher peak blackbody luminosities than the X-ray faint subsample. This sample of optically selected TDEs is the largest sample of TDEs from a single survey yet, and the systematic discovery, classification, and follow-up of this sample allows for robust characterization of TDE properties, an important stepping stone looking forward toward the Rubin era.},

It is the prime result of the computation, and is accompanied by an estimate of numerical uncertainty. Samples from the posterior distribution are an optional by-product, obtainable for any temperature. The method relies on sampling within a hard constraint on likelihood value, as opposed to the softened likelihood of annealing methods. Progress depends only on the shape of the "nested" contours of likelihood, and not on the likelihood values. This invariance (over monotonic re-labelling) allows the method to deal with a class of phase-change problems which effectively defeat thermal annealing.},

	abstract = {We present radio observations of 23 optically-discovered tidal disruption events (TDEs) on timescales of about 500-3200 days post-discovery. We detect 9 new TDEs that did not have detectable radio emission at earlier times, indicating a late-time brightening after several hundred (and up to 2300 days); an additional 6 TDEs exhibit radio emission whose origin is ambiguous or may be attributed to the host galaxy or an AGN. We also report new rising components in two TDEs previously detected in the radio (iPTF16fnl and AT2019dsg) at {\textbackslash}textasciitilde1000 days. While the radio emission in some of the detected TDEs peaked on a timescale of {\textbackslash}textasciitilde2-4 years, more than half of the sample still shows rising emission. The range of luminosities for the sample is 10ˆ37-10ˆ39 erg/s, about two orders of magnitude below the radio luminosity of the relativistic TDE Sw1644+57. Our data set indicates that about 40\% of all optical TDEs are detected in the radio hundreds to thousands of days after discovery, and that this is probably more common than early radio emission peaking at {\textbackslash}textasciitilde100 days. Using an equipartition analysis, we find evidence for a delayed launch of the radio-emitting outflows, with delay timescales of {\textbackslash}textasciitilde500-2000 days, inferred velocities of {\textbackslash}textasciitilde0.02-0.15c, and kinetic energies of {\textbackslash}textasciitilde10ˆ47-10ˆ49 erg. We rule out off-axis relativistic jets as a viable explanation for this population, and conclude delayed outflows are a more likely explanation, such as from delayed disk formation. Finally, we find comparable densities in the circumnuclear environments of these TDEs as for those with early radio emission, and find the TDEs still rising in luminosity are consistent with free expansion. We conclude that late radio emission marks a fairly ubiquitous but heretofore overlooked phase of TDE evolution.},

Here, we model the light curves of 32 optically bright TDEs using the Modular Open Source Fitter for Transients (MOSFIT) to estimate physical and orbital properties, and look for statistical differences between the spectroscopic classes. For all types, we find a shallow distribution of star masses, compared to a typical initial mass function, in the range {\textasciitilde}0.1-1 M⊙, and no TDEs with very deep encounters. Our main result is that TDE-H events appear to come from less complete disruptions (and possibly lower SMBH masses) than TDE-H+He, with TDE-He events fully disrupted. We also find that TDE-H events have more extended photospheres, in agreement with recent literature, and argue that this could be a consequence of differences in the self-intersection radii of the debris streams. Finally, we identify an approximately linear correlation between black hole mass and radiative efficiency. We suggest that TDE-H may be powered by collision-induced outflows at relatively large radii, while TDE-H + He could result from prompt accretion discs, formed more efficiently in closer encounters around more massive SMBHs.},

Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 Englishto-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.},

	abstract = {We present new spectroscopic and photometric follow-up observations of the known sample of extreme coronal line emitting galaxies (ECLEs) identified in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). With these new data, observations of the ECLE sample now span a period of two decades following their initial SDSS detections. We confirm the nonrecurrence of the iron coronal line signatures in five of the seven objects, further supporting their identification as the transient light echoes of tidal disruption events (TDEs). Photometric observations of these objects in optical bands show little overall evolution. In contrast, mid-infrared (MIR) observations show ongoing long-term declines. The remaining two objects had been classified as active galactic nuclei (AGN) with unusually strong coronal lines rather than being TDE related, given the persistence of the coronal lines in earlier follow-up spectra. We confirm this classification, with our spectra continuing to show the presence of strong, unchanged coronal-line features and AGN-like MIR colours and behaviour. We have constructed spectral templates of both subtypes of ECLE to aid in distinguishing the likely origin of newly discovered ECLEs. We highlight the need for higher cadence, and more rapid, follow-up observations of such objects to better constrain their properties and evolution. We also discuss the relationships between ECLEs, TDEs, and other identified transients having significant MIR variability.},

SDSS J0952+2143 is unique in its strong multiwavelength variability; such a broadband emission-line and continuum response has not been observed before. The strong iron line emission is accompanied by unusual Balmer line emission with a broad base, narrow core, and double-peaked narrow horns, and strong He II emission. These lines, while strong in the SDSS spectrum taken in 2005, have faded away significantly in new spectra taken in 2007 December. Comparison of SDSS, 2MASS, GALEX, and follow-up GROND photometry reveals variability in the NUV, optical, and NIR band. Taken together, these unusual observations can be explained by a giant outburst in the EUV-X-ray band, detected even in the optical and NIR. The intense and variable iron, helium, and Balmer lines represent the "light echo" of the flare, as it traveled through circumnuclear material. The outburst may have been caused by the tidal disruption of a star by a supermassive black hole. Spectroscopic surveys such as SDSS are well suited to detect emission-line light echoes of such rare flare events. Reverberation-mapping of these light echoes can then be used as a new and efficient probe of the physical conditions in the circumnuclear material in nonactive or active galaxies.},

The observational evidence for these rare but illuminating phenomena for probing otherwise dormant MBHs first emerged in archival searches of the soft X-ray ROSAT All-Sky Survey in the 1990s, but has recently accelerated with the increasing survey power in the optical time domain, with tidal disruption events (TDEs) now regarded as a class of optical nuclear transients with distinct spectroscopic features. Multiwavelength observations of TDEs have revealed panchromatic emission, probing a wide range of scales, from the innermost regions of the accretion flow to the surrounding circumnuclear medium. I review the current census of 56 TDEs reported in the literature, and their observed properties can be summarized as follows: The optical light curves follow a power-law decline from peak that scales with the inferred central black hole mass as expected for the fallback rate of the stellar debris, but the rise time does not. The UV-optical and soft X-ray thermal emission come from different spatial scales, and their intensity ratio has a large dynamic range and is highly variable, providing important clues as to what is powering the two components. They can be grouped into three spectral classes, and those with Bowen fluorescence line emission show a preference for a hotter and more compact line-emitting region, whereas those with only HeII emission lines are the rarest class.},

To date, observations reveal a surprisingly diverse population. A small fraction of TDEs (at most a few percent) have been observed to produce radio-luminous mildly relativistic jets. The remainder of the population are radio quiet, producing less luminous jets, non-relativistic outflows or, possibly, no radio emission at all. Here, we review the radio observations that have been made of TDEs to date and discuss possible explanations for their properties, focusing on detected sources and, in particular, on the two best-studied events: Sw J1644+57 and ASASSN-14li. We also discuss what we have learned about the host galaxies of TDEs from radio observations and review constraints on the rates of bright and faint radio outflows in TDEs. Upcoming X-ray, optical, near-IR, and radio surveys will greatly expand the sample of TDEs, and technological advances open the exciting possibility of discovering a sample of TDEs in the radio band unbiased by host galaxy extinction.},

In addition to the primary catalog table containing supernova metadata, an individual page is generated for each supernova, which displays its available metadata, light curves, and spectra spanning X-ray to radio frequencies. The data presented in the catalog is automatically rebuilt on a daily basis and is constructed by parsing several dozen sources, including the data presented in the supernova literature and from secondary sources such as other web-based catalogs. Individual supernova data is stored in the hierarchical, human- and machine-readable JSON format, with the entirety of each supernova’s data being contained within a single JSON file bearing its name. The setup we present here, which is based on open-source software maintained via git repositories hosted on github, enables anyone to download the entirety of the supernova data set to their home computer in minutes, and to make contributions of their own data back to the catalog via git. As the supernova data set continues to grow, especially in the upcoming era of all-sky synoptic telescopes, which will increase the total number of events by orders of magnitude, we hope that the catalog we have designed will be a valuable tool for the community to analyze both historical and contemporary supernovae.},

The majority of the ≈60 known TDEs have been discovered with time-domain surveys in the last two decades. Currently, ≈10 TDEs are discovered per year, and this number will increase with the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) at the Rubin Observatory. This work evaluates LSST survey strategies in view of their performance in identifying TDEs. We assume that TDEs can be identified photometrically based on their colors, particularly in the u band, and will be scientifically useful if we can detect the light-curve peak to derive physical quantities. We define the requirements for the Rubin light curves that are needed to achieve this (detections prepeak, postpeak, and in different bands to measure color). We then inject model light curves into the Operations Simulator and calculate the fractions of TDEs passing our requirements for several strategies. We find that under the baseline strategy, ≈1.5\% of simulated TDEs fulfill our detection criteria, while this number increases when more time is devoted to u-band observations. An ideal observing strategy for the photometric identification of TDEs would have longer u-band exposures, which should not come at the expense of fewer u-band visits. A filter distribution weighted toward more observing time in bluer bands, intranight visits in different filters, and strategies with frequent sampling leading to higher-quality light curves are preferred. We find that these strategies benefiting TDE science do not impact significantly other science cases.},

Here we present 17 new TDEs that have been detected recently by the Zwicky Transient Facility along with Swift UV and X-ray follow-up observations. Our homogeneous analysis of the optical/UV light curves, including 22 previously known TDEs from the literature, reveals a clean separation of light-curve properties with spectroscopic class. The TDEs with Bowen fluorescence features in their optical spectra have smaller blackbody radii, lower optical luminosities, and higher disruption rates compared to the rest of the sample. The small subset of TDEs that show only helium emission lines in their spectra have the longest rise times, the highest luminosities, and the lowest rates. A high detection rate of Bowen lines in TDEs with small photometric radii could be explained by the high density that is required for this fluorescence mechanism. The stellar debris can provide a source for this dense material. Diffusion of photons through this debris may explain why the rise and fade timescale of the TDEs in our sample are not correlated. We also report, for the first time, the detection of soft X-ray flares from a TDE on ∼day timescales. Based on the fact that the X-ray flares peak at a luminosity similar to the optical/UV blackbody luminosity, we attribute them to brief glimpses through a reprocessing layer that otherwise obscures the inner accretion flow.},

While we still lack the statistics to do detailed population studies of radio-selected TDEs, we use these events to suggest trends in host galaxy and optical light curve properties that may correlate with the presence of radio emission, and hence can inform optically-selected TDE radio follow-up campaigns. We find that radio-selected TDEs tend to have faint and cool optical flares, as well as host galaxies with low SMBH masses. Our radio-selected TDEs also tend to have more energetic, larger radio emitting regions than radio-detected, optically-selected TDEs. We consider possible explanations for these trends, including by invoking super-Eddington accretion and enhanced circumnuclear media.

Large variations in coronal lines are found in four objects, making them strong candidates for tidal disruption events (TDEs). For the four TDE candidates, all the coronal lines with ionization states higher than [Fe VII] disappear within 5-9 yr. The [Fe VII] line faded by a factor of about five in one object (J0952+2143) within 4 yr, whereas the line emerged in another two objects that previously did not show the line. A strong increment in the [O III] flux is observed, shifting the line ratios toward the loci of active galactic nuclei on the BPT diagram. Surprisingly, we detect a non-canonical [O III] λ5007/[O III] λ4959 ratio of {\textasciitilde}= 2 in two objects, indicating a large column density of O2 + and thus probably optically thick gas. This result also requires a very large ionization parameter and a relatively soft ionizing spectral energy distribution (e.g., a blackbody with T {\textless} 5 × 104 K). Our observations can be explained as the echoing of a strong ultraviolet to soft X-ray flare caused by TDEs on molecular clouds in the inner parsecs of the galactic nuclei. Reanalyzing the Sloan Digital Sky Survey spectra reveals double-peaked or strongly blue-shouldered broad lines in three of the objects, which disappeared in the MMT spectra of two objects and faded by a factor of 10 in 8 yr in the remaining object with a decrease in both the line width and centroid offset. We interpret these broad lines as arising from decelerating biconical outflows. Our results demonstrate that the signatures of echoing can persist for as long as 10 yr and can be used to probe the gas environment in quiescent galactic nuclei.},

Here we report the discovery of extremely strong coronal lines from [Fe X] up to [Fe XIV] in a sample of seven galaxies (including two recently reported cases), which we interpret as such signatures. This is the first systematic search for objects of this kind, by making use of the immense database of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. The galaxies, which are non-active as evidenced by the narrow line ratios, show broad emission lines of complex profiles in more than half of the sample. Both the high-ionization coronal lines and the broad lines are fading on timescales of years in objects observed with spectroscopic follow-ups, suggesting their transient nature. Variations of inferred non-stellar continua, which have absolute magnitudes of at least -16 to -18 mag in the g band, are also detected in more than half of the sample. The coronal line emitters reside in sub-L * disk galaxies (-21.3 {\textless} Mi {\textless} -18.5) with small stellar velocity dispersions. The sample seems to form two distinct types based on the presence or absence of the [Fe VII] lines, with the latter having relatively low luminosities of [O III], [Fe XI], and the host galaxies. These characteristics can most naturally be understood in the context of transient accretion onto intermediate-mass black holes at galactic centers following tidal disruption of stars in a gas-rich environment. We estimate the incidence of such events to be around 10-5 yr-1 for a galaxy with -21.3 {\textless} Mi {\textless} -18.5.},

	abstract = {Stars in the immediate vicinity of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) can be ripped apart by the tidal forces of the black hole. The subsequent accretion of the stellar material causes a spectacular flare of electromagnetic radiation. Here, we provide a review of the observations of tidal disruption events (TDEs), with an emphasis on the important contributions of Swift to this field. TDEs represent a new probe of matter under strong gravity, and have opened up a new window into studying accretion physics under extreme conditions. The events probe relativistic effects, provide a new means of measuring black hole spin, and represent signposts of intermediate-mass BHs, binary BHs and recoiling BHs. Luminous, high-amplitude X-ray flares, matching key predictions of the tidal disruption scenario, have first been discovered with ROSAT, and more recently with other missions and in other wavebands. The Swift discovery of two gamma-ray emitting, jetted TDEs, never seen before, has provided us with a unique probe of the early phases of jet formation and evolution, and SwiftJ1644+75 has the best covered lightcurve of any TDE to date. Further, Swift has made important contributions in providing well-covered lightcurves of TDEs discovered with other instruments, setting constraints on the physics that govern the TDE evolution, and including the discovery of the first candidate binary SMBH identified from a TDE lightcurve.},

	abstract = {We describe here the most ambitious survey currently planned in the optical, the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST). The LSST design is driven by four main science themes: probing dark energy and dark matter, taking an inventory of the solar system, exploring the transient optical sky, and mapping the Milky Way. LSST will be a large, wide-field ground-based system designed to obtain repeated images covering the sky visible from Cerro Pachón in northern Chile. The telescope will have an 8.4 m (6.5 m effective) primary mirror, a 9.6 deg2 field of view, a 3.2-gigapixel camera, and six filters (ugrizy) covering the wavelength range 320-1050 nm. The project is in the construction phase and will begin regular survey operations by 2022. About 90\% of the observing time will be devoted to a deep-wide-fast survey mode that will uniformly observe a 18,000 deg2 region about 800 times (summed over all six bands) during the anticipated 10 yr of operations and will yield a co-added map to r ∼ 27.5. These data will result in databases including about 32 trillion observations of 20 billion galaxies and a similar number of stars, and they will serve the majority of the primary science programs. The remaining 10\% of the observing time will be allocated to special projects such as Very Deep and Very Fast time domain surveys, whose details are currently under discussion. We illustrate how the LSST science drivers led to these choices of system parameters, and we describe the expected data products and their characteristics.},

	abstract = {Recent observations presented in Cendes et al. (2024a) show that optically selected tidal disruption events (TDEs) commonly produce delayed radio emission that can peak years post-disruption. Here, we explore the multi-wavelength properties of a sample of radio-observed optically selected TDEs to shed light on the physical process(es) responsible for the late-rising radio emission. We combine new late-time X-ray observations with archival optical, UV, X-ray, and radio data to conclude that a diversity of accretion-driven outflows may power delayed radio emission in TDEs. Simultaneous X-ray data and modeling of the UV/optical emission suggest that some late radio outflows may be launched by a delayed phase of super-Eddington accretion onto the central supermassive black hole (SMBH), while others may result from a state transition to a "low-hard" radiatively inefficient accretion flow or the deceleration of an off-axis relativistic jet. We additionally find weak statistical evidence that TDEs with delayed radio emission have larger optical/UV photospheric radii than other TDEs and are less likely to exhibit helium emission lines at early times, possibly also supporting the hypothesis that the onset of SMBH accretion is delayed in these systems. Our results have implications for our understanding of state changes in SMBH accretion flows, the circularization timescale for TDE debris, and the prevalence of off-axis jets in TDEs, and motivates systematic, long-term monitoring of these unique transients. The brightest objects in our sample are also detected in the VLA Sky Survey (VLASS), demonstrating that all-sky radio surveys can play an important role in discovering unexpected radio properties of the TDE population.},

Optical–ultraviolet observations5–7 of TDEs contradict simple models of TDE emission2,8, but the debate between alternative models (for example, shock power9,10 or reprocessed accretion power11–16) remains unsettled, as the dynamic range of the problem has so far prevented ab initio hydrodynamical simulations17. Consequently, past simulations have resorted to unrealistic parameter choices10,12,18–21, artificial mass injection schemes22,23 or very short run-times24. Here we present a three-dimensional radiation-hydrodynamic simulation of a TDE flare from disruption to peak emission, with typical astrophysical parameters. At early times, shocks near pericentre power the light curve and a previously unknown source of X-ray emission, but circularization and outflows are inefficient. Near peak light, stream–disk shocks efficiently circularize returning debris, power stronger outflows and reproduce observed peak optical–ultraviolet luminosities25,26. Peak emission in this simulation is shock-powered, but upper limits on accretion power become competitive near peak light as circularization runs away. This simulation shows how deterministic predictions of TDE light curves and spectra can be calculated using moving-mesh hydrodynamics algorithms.},

Rapid, scalable photometric classification methods are therefore essential for identifying young SNe for follow-up and enabling large-scale population studies. We present SPLASH, a host-based classification pipeline that infers supernova classes using only host galaxy photometry. SPLASH first associates SNe with their hosts (yielding a redshift estimate), then infers host galaxy stellar mass and star formation rate using deep learning, and finally classifies SNe using a random forest trained on these inferred properties, along with host-SN angular separation and redshift. SPLASH achieves a binary (Type Ia vs. core-collapse) classification accuracy of \$76{\textbackslash}\%\$ and an F1-score of \$69{\textbackslash}\%\$, comparable to other state-of-the-art methods. By selecting only the most confident predictions, SPLASH can return highly pure subsets of all major SN types, making it well-suited for targeted follow-up. Its efficient design allows classification of \${\textbackslash}sim 500\$ SNe per second, making it ideal for next-generation surveys. Moreover, its intermediate inference step enables selection of transients by host environment, providing a tool not only for classification but also for probing the demographics of stellar death.},

Rubin Observatory. Here, we present a photometric classifier for SN light curves that does not rely on redshift information and still maintains comparable accuracy to redshift-dependent classifiers. Our new package, Superphot+, uses a parametric model to extract meaningful features from multiband SN light curves. We train a gradient-boosted machine with fit parameters from 6061 ZTF SNe that pass data quality cuts and are spectroscopically classified as one of five classes: SN Ia, SN II, SN Ib/c, SN IIn, and SLSN-I. Without redshift information, our classifier yields a class-averaged F 1-score of 0.61 ± 0.02 and a total accuracy of 0.83 ± 0.01. Including redshift information improves these metrics to 0.71 ± 0.02 and 0.88 ± 0.01, respectively. We assign new class probabilities to 3558 ZTF transients that show SN-like characteristics (based on the ALeRCE Broker light-curve and stamp classifiers) but lack spectroscopic classifications. Finally, we compare our predicted SN labels with those generated by the ALeRCE light-curve classifier, finding that the two classifiers agree on photometric labels for 82\% ± 2\% of light curves with spectroscopic labels and 72\% ± 0\% of light curves without spectroscopic labels. Superphot+ is currently classifying ZTF SNe in real time via the ANTARES Broker, and is designed for simple adaptation to six-band Rubin light curves in the future.},

	abstract = {A tidal disruption event (TDE) of a star by a massive black hole yields a short and luminous flare of radiation, thus providing a unique signpost of otherwise dormant black holes. While the detection rate of optical TDEs is accelerating, our understanding of their optical emission has hit a formidable obstacle: the missing energy problem. The observed electromagnetic output of TDEs is almost four orders of magnitude lower than the gravitational potential energy that must be released when a star is accreted. This missing energy could either be emitted over a much longer timescale than the optical flare, or it could be emitted promptly but in the extreme-UV band. Discriminating between these two models will be required to unlock TDEs as tools for black hole demographics. Fortunately, the infrared reverberation signal from dust heated by a TDE can be used to measure the total energy of the event. These TDE dust echoes have recently been discovered, however their use as bolometers requires a much better measurement of the dust temperature and composition. JWST is ideally suited to make these observations. With a sequence of spectroscopic observations triggered on an IR-bright TDE, we will measure the dust grain sublimation rate by comparing the nuclear hot dust spectrum to its pristine off-nuclear state. And because circumnuclear dust in TDEs is suddenly exposed to UV radiation we will also constrain the grain properties via the temporal variability of the emission lines. These observations will yield the first-ever infrared spectra of a TDE, allowing us to solve the missing energy problem and measure the dust covering factor at sub-parsec scales.},

	abstract = {Using archival Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) multi-epoch imaging data (Stripe 82), we have searched for the tidal disruption of stars by supermassive black holes in non-active galaxies. Two candidate tidal disruption events (TDEs) are identified. The TDE flares have optical blackbody temperatures of 2 × 104 K and observed peak luminosities of Mg = -18.3 and -20.4 (νL ν = 5 × 1042, 4 × 1043 erg s-1, in the rest frame); their cooling rates are very low, qualitatively consistent with expectations for tidal disruption flares. The properties of the TDE candidates are examined using (1) SDSS imaging to compare them to other flares observed in the search, (2) UV emission measured by GALEX, and (3) spectra of the hosts and of one of the flares. Our pipeline excludes optically identifiable AGN hosts, and our variability monitoring over nine years provides strong evidence that these are not flares in hidden AGNs. The spectra and color evolution of the flares are unlike any SN observed to date, their strong late-time UV emission is particularly distinctive, and they are nuclear at high resolution arguing against these being first cases of a previously unobserved class of SNe or more extreme examples of known SN types. Taken together, the observed properties are difficult to reconcile with an SN or an AGN-flare explanation, although an entirely new process specific to the inner few hundred parsecs of non-active galaxies cannot be excluded. Based on our observed rate, we infer that hundreds or thousands of TDEs will be present in current and next-generation optical synoptic surveys. Using the approach outlined here, a TDE candidate sample with O(1) purity can be selected using geometric resolution and host and flare color alone, demonstrating that a campaign to create a large sample of TDEs, with immediate and detailed multi-wavelength follow-up, is feasible. A by-product of this work is quantification of the power spectrum of extreme flares in AGNs.},

We use the Lasair transient broker to search Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) data for transients lasting more than one year and exhibiting smooth declines. Our search returns 59 events, 7 of which we classify as ANTs assumed to be driven by accretion onto supermassive black holes. We propose the remaining 52 are stochastic variability from regular supermassive black hole accretion rather than distinct transients. We supplement the seven ANTs with three nuclear transients in ZTF that fail the light curve selection but have clear single flares and spectra that do not resemble typical active galactic nucleus. All of these 11 ANTs have a mid-infrared flare from an assumed dust echo, implying the ubiquity of dust around the black holes giving rise to ANTs. No events are more luminous than AT2021lwx, but one (ZTF19aamrjar) has twice the duration and a higher integrated energy release. On the other extreme, ZTF20abodaps reaches a luminosity close to AT2021lwx with a rise time \$ 20\$ d and that fades smoothly in \$ 600\$ d. We define a portion of rise-time versus flare amplitude space that selects ANTs with \${\textbackslash}sim 50\$ per cent purity against variable AGNs.

	abstract = {Recent claimed detections of tidal disruption events (TDEs) in multi-wavelength data have opened potential new windows into the evolution and properties of otherwise dormant supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in the centres of galaxies. At present, there are several dozen TDE candidates, which share some properties and differ in others. The range in properties is broad enough to overlap other transient types, such as active galactic nuclei (AGN) and supernovae (SNe), which can make TDE classification ambiguous. A further complication is that “TDE signatures” have not been uniformly observed to similar sensitivities or even targeted across all candidates. This chapter both reviews those events that are unusual relative to other TDEs, including the possibility of TDEs in pre-existing AGN, and summarises those characteristics thought to best distinguish TDEs from continuously accreting AGN, strongly flaring AGN, SNe, and Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs), as well as other potential impostors like stellar collisions, “micro-TDEs,” and circumbinary accretion flows. We conclude that multiple observables should be used to classify any one event as a TDE. We also consider the TDE candidate population as a whole, which, for certain host galaxy or SMBH characteristics, is distinguishable statistically from non-TDEs, suggesting that at least some TDE candidates do in fact arise from SMBH-disrupted stars.},

	abstract = {The disruption of stars by supermassive black holes has been linked to more than a dozen flares in the cores of galaxies out to redshift z ∼ 0.4. Modeling these flares properly requires a prediction of the rate of mass return to the black hole after a disruption. Through hydrodynamical simulation, we show that aside from the full disruption of a solar mass star at the exact limit where the star is destroyed, the common assumptions used to estimate , the rate of mass return to the black hole, are largely invalid. While the analytical approximation to tidal disruption predicts that the least-centrally concentrated stars and the deepest encounters should have more quickly-peaked flares, we find that the most-centrally concentrated stars have the quickest-peaking flares, and the trend between the time of peak and the impact parameter for deeply penetrating encounters reverses beyond the critical distance at which the star is completely destroyed. We also show that the most-centrally concentrated stars produced a characteristic drop in shortly after peak when a star is only partially disrupted, with the power law index n being as extreme as −4 in the months immediately following the peak of a flare. Additionally, we find that n asymptotes to ≃ − 2.2 for both low- and high-mass stars for approximately half of all stellar disruptions. Both of these results are significantly steeper than the typically assumed n = −5/3. As these precipitous decay rates are only seen for events in which a stellar core survives the disruption, they can be used to determine if an observed tidal disruption flare produced a surviving remnant. We provide fitting formulae for four fundamental quantities of tidal disruption as functions of the star's distance to the black hole at pericenter and its stellar structure: the total mass lost, the time of peak, the accretion rate at peak, and the power-law index shortly after peak. These results should be taken into consideration when flares arising from tidal disruptions are modeled.},

We perform local three-dimensional radiation hydrodynamic simulations in a wedge geometry including the gravity to study stream self-crossing with an emphasis on resolving the collision and following the subsequent outflow. We find that the collision can contribute to prepeak optical emissions by converting ≳5\% of the stream kinetic energy to radiation, yielding prompt emission of ∼1042−44 erg s−1. The radiative efficiency is sensitive to stream mass fallback rates and strongly depends on the downstream gas optical depth. Even for a sub-Eddington (10\%) mass fallback rate, the strong radiation pressure produced in the collision can form a local super-Eddington region near the collision site, where a fast, aspherical outflow is launched. A higher mass fallback rate usually leads to more optically thick outflow and lower net radiative efficiency. For , the estimated photosphere size of the outflow can expand by 1–2 orders of magnitude, reaching ∼1014 cm. The average gas temperature at this photospheric surface is a few × 104 K, roughly consistent with inferred prepeak photosphere properties for some optical TDEs. We find that the dynamics is sensitive to the collision angle and radius, but the radiative efficiency or outflow properties show more complex dependency than is often assumed in ballistic models.},

	abstract = {We present an analytical and fully relativistic framework for studying the self-intersection of tidal disruption event (TDE) streams, restricting ourselves to the Schwarzschild spacetime. By taking advantage of the closed-form solution to the geodesic equations in the Schwarzschild metric, we calculate properties of the self-intersection without numerically evaluating the geodesic equations or making any post-Newtonian approximations. Our analytical treatment also facilitates geometric definitions of the orbital semimajor axis and eccentricity, as opposed to Newtonian formulas which lead to unphysical results for highly relativistic orbits. Combined with assumptions about energy dissipation during the self-intersection shock, our framework enables the calculation of quantities such as the fraction of material unbound during the self-intersection shock, and the characteristic semimajor axes and eccentricities of the material that remains in orbit after the collision. As an example, we calculate grids of post-intersection properties in stellar and supermassive black hole (SMBH) masses for disruptions of main-sequence stars, identifying regions where no material is ejected during self-intersection (e.g. SMBH mass \${\textbackslash}lesssim 5{\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}6{\textbackslash}, \{{\textbackslash}rm M\_{\textbackslash}odot \}\$ for \$1{\textbackslash}, \{{\textbackslash}rm M\_{\textbackslash}odot \}\$ stars disrupted at the tidal radius), potentially explaining the TDEs observed by SGR/eROSITA that are visible in X-rays but not optical wavelengths. We also identify parameters for which the post-intersection accretion flow has low eccentricity (e ≲ 0.6), and find that the luminosity generated by self-intersection shocks only agrees with observed trends in the relationship between light curve decay time-scales and peak luminosities over a narrow range of SMBH masses.},

We perform three-dimensional radiation hydrodynamic simulations to show that stream collisions can contribute significant optical and ultraviolet light to the flares produced by TDEs, and can explain the majority of the observed emission. Our simulations focus on the region near the radiation-pressure-dominated shock produced by a collision and track how the kinetic energy of the stream is dissipated by the associated shock. When the mass flow rate of the stream {\textbackslash}dot\{M\} is a significant fraction of the Eddington accretion rate, ≳2\% of the initial kinetic energy is converted to radiation as a result of the collision. In this regime, the collision redistributes the specific kinetic energy into the downstream gas and more than 16\% of the mass can become unbound. The fraction of unbound gas decreases rapidly as {\textbackslash}dot\{M\} drops significantly below the Eddington limit, with no unbound gas being produced when {\textbackslash}dot\{M\} drops to 1\% of Eddington; we find, however, that the radiative efficiency increases slightly to ≲8\% in these cases of low {\textbackslash}dot\{M\}. The effective radiation temperature and size of the photosphere are determined by the stream velocity and {\textbackslash}dot\{M\}, and we find them to be a few times 104 K and 1014 cm in our calculations, comparable to the values inferred for some TDE candidates. The size of the photosphere is directly proportional to {\textbackslash}dot\{M\}, which can explain its rapidly changing size as seen in TDE candidates such as PS1-10jh.},

Combining a relativistic hydrodynamic simulation of the stellar disruption with a relativistic hydrodynamics simulation of the subsequent debris motion, we track the evolution of such a system until ≃ 80\% of the stellar mass bound to the black hole has settled into an accretion flow. Shocks near the stellar pericenter and also near the apocenter of the most tightly bound debris dissipate orbital energy, but only enough to make its characteristic radius comparable to the semimajor axis of the most bound material, not the tidal radius as previously envisioned. The outer shocks are caused by post-Newtonian relativistic effects, both on the stellar orbit during its disruption and on the tidal forces. Accumulation of mass into the accretion flow is both non-monotonic and slow, requiring several to 10 times the orbital period of the most tightly bound tidal streams, while the inflow time for most of the mass may be comparable to or longer than the mass accumulation time. Deflection by shocks does, however, cause some mass to lose both angular momentum and energy, permitting it to move inward even before most of the mass is accumulated into the accretion flow. Although the accretion rate still rises sharply and then decays roughly as a power law, its maximum is ≃ 0.1× the previous expectation, and the timescale of the peak is ≃ 5× longer than previously predicted. The geometric mean of the black hole mass and stellar mass inferred from a measured event timescale is therefore ≃ 0.2× the value given by classical theory.},

	abstract = {We propose a semi-analytical model for the self-intersection of the fallback stream in tidal disruption events (TDEs). When the initial periapsis is less than about 15 gravitational radii, a large fraction of the shocked gas is unbound in the form of a collision-induced outflow (CIO). This is because large apsidal precession causes the stream to self-intersect near the local escape speed at radius much below the apocentre. The rest of the fallback gas is left in more tightly bound orbits and quickly joins the accretion flow. We propose that the CIO is responsible for reprocessing the hard emission from the accretion flow into the optical band. This picture naturally explains the large photospheric radius [or low blackbody (BB) temperature] and typical line widths for optical TDEs. We predict the CIO-reprocessed spectrum in the infrared to be Lν ∝ ν∼0.5, shallower than a BB. The partial sky coverage of the CIO also provides a unification of the diverse X-ray behaviours of optical TDEs. According to this picture, optical surveys filter out a large fraction of TDEs with low-mass blackholes due to lack of a reprocessing layer, and the volumetric rate of optical TDEs is nearly flat wrt. the blackhole mass in the range M≲ 10{\textasciicircum}7 M\_\{⊙\}. This filtering also causes the optical TDE rate to be lower than the total rate by a factor of ∼10 or more. When the CIO is decelerated by the ambient medium, radio emission at the level of that in ASASSN-14li is produced, but the time-scales and peak luminosities can be highly diverse. Finally, our method paves the way for global simulations of the disc formation process by injecting gas at the intersection point according to the prescribed velocity and density profiles.},

	abstract = {Observations of tidal disruption events on timescales of years after the main flare show evidence of continued activity in the form of optical/UV emission, quasiperiodic eruptions, and delayed radio flares. Motivated by this, we explore the time evolution of these disks, using semi-analytic models to follow the changing disk properties and feeding rate to the central black hole. We find that thermal instabilities typically begin ∼100 days after the TDE, causing the disk to cycle between high and low accretion states for up to ∼10 yr. The high state is super-Eddington, which may be associated with outflows that eject ∼10‑3–10‑1 M⊙ over ∼1–2 days, with a range of velocities ∼0.03–0.3c. Collisions between these mass ejections may cause radio flares. In the low state, the accretion rate slowly grows over months to years, as continued fallback accretion builds the disk's mass. In this phase, the disk has a luminosity of ∼1041–1042 erg s‑1 in the optical/UV, as seen in some late-time observations. Although the accretion cycles we find occur for a typical α-disk, in nature, the disk could be stabilized by other effects, such as the disk's magnetic field or heating from fallback accretion, the latter of which we explore. Thus, higher-cadence optical/UV observations along with joint radio monitoring will be key for following the disk state and testing these models.},

	abstract = {We study the emission from tidal disruption events (TDEs) produced as radiation from black hole accretion propagates through an extended, optically thick envelope formed from stellar debris. We analytically describe key physics controlling spectrum formation, and present detailed radiative transfer calculations that model the spectral energy distribution and optical line strengths of TDEs near peak brightness. The steady-state transfer is coupled to a solver for the excitation and ionization states of hydrogen, helium, and oxygen (as a representative metal), without assuming local thermodynamic equilibrium. Our calculations show how an extended envelope can reprocess a fraction of soft X-rays and produce the observed optical fluxes of the order of 1043 erg s−1, with an optical/UV continuum that is not described by a single blackbody. Variations in the mass or size of the envelope may help explain how the optical flux changes over time with roughly constant color. For high enough accretion luminosities, X-rays can escape to be observed simultaneously with the optical flux. Due to optical depth effects, hydrogen Balmer line emission is often strongly suppressed relative to helium line emission (with He ii-to-H line ratios of at least 5:1 in some cases) even in the disruption of a solar-composition star. We discuss the implications of our results to understanding the type of stars destroyed in TDEs and the physical processes responsible for producing the observed flares.},

As this gas is tenuously gravitationally bound and unable to cool radiatively, only a small fraction fin ≪ 1 may accrete, with the majority instead becoming unbound in an outflow of velocity ∼104 km s−1. The outflow spreads laterally as it expands to large radii, encasing the SMBH and blocking the inner disc's EUV/X-ray radiation, which becomes trapped in a radiation-dominated nebula. Ionizing nebular radiation heats the inner edge of the ejecta, converting the emission to optical/near-UV wavelengths where photons more readily escape due to the lower opacity. This can explain the unexpectedly low and temporally constant effective temperatures of optically discovered tidal disruption event (TDE) flares. For high-mass SMBHs, M• ≳ 107 M⊙, the ejecta can become fully ionized at an earlier stage, or for a wider range of viewing angles, producing a TDE flare accompanied by thermal X-ray emission. The peak optical luminosity is suppressed as the result of adiabatic losses in the inner disc wind when M• ≪ 107 M⊙, possibly contributing to the unexpected dearth of optical TDEs in galaxies with low-mass SMBHs. In the classical picture, where fin ≈ 1, TDEs de-spin supermassive SMBHs and cap their maximum spins well below theoretical accretion physics limits.

	abstract = {We present radio observations of 23 optically discovered tidal disruption events (TDEs) on timescales of ∼500–3200 days postdiscovery. We detect nine new TDEs that did not have detectable radio emission at earlier times, indicating a late-time brightening after several hundred (and up to 2300) days; an additional seven TDEs exhibit radio emission whose origin is ambiguous or may be attributed to the host galaxy or an active galactic nucleus. We also report a new rising component in one TDE previously detected in the radio at ∼103 days. While the radio emission in some of the detected TDEs peaked on a timescale ≈2–4 yr, over half of the sample still show rising emission. The range of luminosities for the sample is ∼1037–1039 erg s‑1, about 2 orders of magnitude below the radio luminosity of the relativistic TDE Sw J1644+57. Our data set indicates ∼40\% of all optical TDEs are detected in radio hundreds to thousands of days after discovery, and that this is probably more common than early radio emission peaking at ∼102 days. Using an equipartition analysis, we find evidence for a delayed launch of the radio-emitting outflows, with delay timescales of ∼500–2000 days, inferred velocities of ≈0.02–0.15c, and kinetic energies of ∼1047–1049 erg. We rule out off-axis relativistic jets as a viable explanation for this population, and conclude delayed outflows are a more likely explanation, possibly from delayed disk formation. We conclude late radio emission marks a fairly ubiquitous but heretofore overlooked phase of TDE evolution.},

FLEET is based on a random forest algorithm trained on both the light curves and host galaxy information of 4779 spectroscopically classified transients. We find that for transients with a probability of being a TDE, P(TDE) {\textgreater} 0.5, we can successfully recover TDEs with ≈40\% completeness and ≈30\% purity when using their first 20 days of photometry or a similar completeness and ≈50\% purity when including 40 days of photometry, an improvement of almost 2 orders of magnitude compared to random selection. Alternatively, we can recover TDEs with a maximum purity of ≈80\% and a completeness of ≈30\% when considering only transients with P(TDE) {\textgreater} 0.8. We explore the use of FLEET for future time-domain surveys such as the Legacy Survey of Space and Time on the Vera C. Rubin Observatory (Rubin) and the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope (Roman). We estimate that {\textasciitilde}104 well-observed TDEs could be discovered every year by Rubin and {\textasciitilde}200 TDEs by Roman. Finally, we run FLEET on the TDEs from our Rubin survey simulation and find that we can recover {\textasciitilde}30\% of them at redshift z {\textless} 0.5 with P(TDE) {\textgreater} 0.5, or {\textasciitilde}3000 TDEs yr-1 that FLEET could uncover from the Rubin stream.

Previously reported X-ray observations of this TDE showed variability at early times and a dramatic increase in luminosity, by a factor of ∼10, about 8 months after optical discovery. The X-ray emission is mainly dominated by intermediate hard-soft X-rays and is exceptionally soft around the X-ray peak, which is L X ∼ 1043 erg s−1. The high cadence 15.5 GHz observations reported here show an early rise in radio emission followed by an approximately constant light curve, and a late-time flare. This flare starts roughly at the time of the observed X-ray peak luminosity and reaches its peak about 110 days after the peak in the X-ray, and a year after optical discovery. The radio flare peaks at ν L ν ∼ 1038 erg s−1, a factor of two higher than the emission preceding the flare. In light of the late-time radio and X-ray flares, and the X-ray spectral evolution, we speculate a possible transition in the accretion state of this TDE, similar to the observed behavior in black hole X-ray binaries. We compare the radio properties of AT 2019azh to other known TDEs, and focus on the similarities to the late-time radio flare of the TDE ASASSN-15oi.},

The solutions are divided into on-axis and off-axis branches, with the former reproducing the classical analysis. A relativistic source viewed off-axis can be disguised as an apparent Newtonian one. Applying this method to radio observations of several tidal disruption events, we find that the radio flare of AT 2018hyz, which was observed a few years after the optical discovery, could have been produced by a relativistic off-axis jet with a kinetic energy of \${\textbackslash}sim 10{\textasciicircum}\{53\}{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}rm erg\$ that was launched around the time of discovery.},

Given the increasing transient discovery rate in the coming years, there is substantial utility in providing public, transparent, reproducible, and automatic characterization for large samples of transient host galaxies. Here we present Blast, a web application that ingests live streams of transient alerts, matches transients to their host galaxies, and performs photometry on coincident archival imaging data of the host galaxy. The photometry is then used to infer both global host-galaxy properties and galaxy properties within 2 kpc of the transient location by using the Prospector Bayesian inference framework, with an acceleration in evaluation speed achieved via simulation-based inference. Blast provides host-galaxy properties to users via a web browser or an application program interface. The software can be extended to support alternative photometric or SED-fitting algorithms, and can be scaled via an asynchronous worker queue across multiple compute nodes to handle the processing of large volumes of transient alerts for upcoming transient surveys. Blast has been ingesting newly discovered transients from the Transient Name Server since mid-2024, and has currently measured SED parameters for more than 6000 transients.

Detailed studies of some of these TDEs at radio wavelengths are also challenging the existing models for radio emission. Using all-sky multiepoch data from the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP), taken as a part of the Rapid ASKAP Continuum Survey (RACS), we searched for radio counterparts to a sample of optically discovered TDEs. We detected late-time emission at RACS frequencies (742–1032 MHz) in five TDEs, reporting the independent discovery of radio emission from TDE AT 2019ahk and extending the time baseline out to almost 3000 days for some events. Overall, we find that at least 22‑11+15\% of the population of optically discovered TDEs has detectable radio emission in the RACS survey, while also noting that the true fraction can be higher given the limited cadence (two epochs separated by ∼3 yr) of the survey. Finally, we project that the ongoing higher-cadence (∼2 months) ASKAP Variable and Slow Transients survey can detect ∼20 TDEs in its operational span (4 yr), given the current rate from optical surveys.},

	abstract = {We present a pan-chromatic study of AT2017bcc, a nuclear transient that was discovered in 2017 within the skymap of a reported burst-like gravitational-wave candidate, G274296. It was initially classified as a superluminous supernova, and then reclassified as a candidate tidal disruption event. Its optical light curve has since shown ongoing variability with a structure function consistent with that of an active galactic nucleus, however, earlier data show no variability for at least 10 yr prior to the outburst in 2017. The spectrum shows complex profiles in the broad Balmer lines: a central component with a broad-blue wing, and a boxy component with time-variable blue and red shoulders. The H α emission profile is well modelled using a circular accretion disc component, and a blue-shifted double Gaussian which may indicate a partially obscured outflow. Weak narrow lines, together with the previously flat light curve, suggest that this object represents a dormant galactic nucleus which has recently been re-activated. Our time-series modelling of the Balmer lines suggests that this is connected to a disturbance in the disc morphology, and we speculate this could involve a sudden violent event such as a tidal disruption event involving the central supermassive black hole, though this cannot be confirmed, and given an estimated black hole mass of ≳ 107-108 M⊙ instabilities in an existing disc may be more likely. Although we find that the redshifts of AT2017bcc (z = 0.13) and G274296 (z {\textgreater} 0.42) are inconsistent, this event adds to the growing diversity of both nuclear transients and multimessenger contaminants.},

	abstract = {The physical sizes of tidal disruption event (TDE) accretion discs are regularly inferred, from modelling of the TDEs X-ray spectrum as a single-temperature blackbody, to be smaller than the plausible event horizons of the black holes which they occur around - a clearly unphysical result. In this Lltter, we demonstrate that the use of single-temperature blackbody functions results in the systematic underestimation of TDE accretion disc sizes by as much as an order of magnitude. In fact, the radial 'size' inferred from fitting a single-temperature blackbody to an observed accretion disc X-ray spectrum does not even positively correlate with the physical size of that accretion disc. We further demonstrate that the disc-observer inclination angle and absorption of X-ray photons may both lead to additional underestimation of the radial sizes of TDE discs, but by smaller factors. To rectify these issues, we present a new fitting function which accurately reproduces the size of an accretion disc from its 0.3-10 keV X-ray spectrum. Unlike traditional approaches, this new fitting function does not assume that the accretion disc has reached a steady-state configuration, an assumption which is unlikely to be satisfied by most TDEs.},

	abstract = {We present late time multi-wavelength observations of Swift J1644+57, suggested to be a relativistic tidal disruption flare (TDF). Our observations extend to {\textgreater}4 years from discovery and show that 1.4 years after outburst the relativistic jet switched off on a timescale less than tens of days, corresponding to a power-law decay faster than t-70. Beyond this point weak X-rays continue to be detected at an approximately constant luminosity of LX ∼ 5 × 1042 erg s-1 and are marginally inconsistent with a continuing decay of t-5/3, similar to that seen prior to the switch-off. Host photometry enables us to infer a black hole mass of MBH = 3 × 106 M⊙, consistent with the late time X-ray luminosity arising from sub-Eddington accretion onto the black hole in the form of either an unusually optically faint active galactic nucleus or a slowly varying phase of the transient. Optical/IR observations show a clear bump in the light curve at timescales of 30-50 days, with a peak magnitude (corrected for host galaxy extinction) of MR ∼ -22 to -23. The luminosity of the bump is significantly higher than seen in other, non-relativistic TDFs and does not match any re-brightening seen at X-ray or radio wavelengths. Its luminosity, light curve shape, and spectrum are broadly similar to those seen in superluminous supervnovae, although subject to large uncertainties in the correction of the significant host extinction. We discuss these observations in the context of both TDF and massive star origins for Swift J1644+5734 and other candidate relativistic tidal flares.},

	abstract = {The high spatial resolution and precise astrometry and photometry of the Gaia mission should make it particularly apt at discovering and resolving transients occurring in, or near, the centres of galaxies. Indeed, some nuclear transients are reported by the Gaia Science Alerts (GSA) team, but not a single confirmed tidal disruption event (TDE) has been published. In order to explore the sensitivity of GSA, we performed an independent and systematic search for nuclear transients using Gaia observations. Our transient search is driven from an input galaxy catalogue (derived from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Release 12). We present a candidate detection metric that is independent from the existing GSA methodology, to see if Gaia Alerts are biased against the discovery of nuclear transients, and in particular which steps may have an impact. Our technique does require significant manual vetting of candidates, making implementation in the GSA system impractical for daily operations, although it could be run weekly, which for month-to-year long transients would make a scientifically valuable addition. Our search yielded ∼480 nuclear transients, five of which were alerted and published by GSA. The list of (in some cases ongoing) transients includes candidates for events related to enhanced accretion onto a supermassive black hole and TDEs. An implementation of the detection methodology and criteria used in this paper as an extension of GSA could open up the possibility for Gaia to fulfil the role as a main tool to find transient nuclear activity as predicted in the literature.},

We combine YSE and ZTF data, and create multisurvey SN simulations to train the ParSNIP and SuperRAENN photometric classification algorithms; when validating our ParSNIP classifier on 472 spectroscopically classified YSE DR1 SNe, we achieve 82\% accuracy across three SN classes (SNe Ia, II, Ib/Ic) and 90\% accuracy across two SN classes (SNe Ia, core-collapse SNe). Our classifier performs particularly well on SNe Ia, with high ({\textgreater}90\%) individual completeness and purity, which will help build an anchor photometric SNe Ia sample for cosmology. We then use our photometric classifier to characterize our photometric sample of 1483 SNe, labeling 1048 ({\textasciitilde}71\%) SNe Ia, 339 ({\textasciitilde}23\%) SNe II, and 96 ({\textasciitilde}6\%) SNe Ib/Ic.

	abstract = {Tidal disruption events (TDEs) are bursts of electromagnetic energy that are released when supermassive black holes at the centres of galaxies violently disrupt a star that passes too close1. TDEs provide a window through which to study accretion onto supermassive black holes; in some rare cases, this accretion leads to launching of a relativistic jet2-9, but the necessary conditions are not fully understood. The best-studied jetted TDE so far is Swift J1644+57, which was discovered in γ-rays, but was too obscured by dust to be seen at optical wavelengths. Here we report the optical detection of AT2022cmc, a rapidly fading source at cosmological distance (redshift z = 1.19325) the unique light curve of which transitioned into a luminous plateau within days. Observations of a bright counterpart at other wavelengths, including X-ray, submillimetre and radio, supports the interpretation of AT2022cmc as a jetted TDE containing a synchrotron `afterglow', probably launched by a supermassive black hole with spin greater than approximately 0.3. Using four years of Zwicky Transient Facility10 survey data, we calculate a rate of 0.0 2−0.01+0.04 Gpc−3 yr−1 for on-axis jetted TDEs on the basis of the luminous, fast-fading red component, thus providing a measurement complementary to the rates derived from X-ray and radio observations11. Correcting for the beaming angle effects, this rate confirms that approximately 1 per cent of TDEs have relativistic jets. Optical surveys can use AT2022cmc as a prototype to unveil a population of jetted TDEs.},

	abstract = {We present the first sample of tidal disruption events (TDEs) discovered during the SRG all-sky survey. These 13 events were selected among X-ray transients detected in the 0° {\textless} l {\textless} 180° hemisphere by eROSITA during its second sky survey (2020 June 10 to December 14) and confirmed by optical follow-up observations. The most distant event occurred at z = 0.581. One TDE continued to brighten at least 6 months. The X-ray spectra are consistent with nearly critical accretion on to black holes of a few ×103 to \$10{\textasciicircum}8{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mathrm\{ M\}\_{\textbackslash}odot\$, although supercritical accretion is possibly taking place. In two TDEs, a spectral hardening is observed 6 months after the discovery. Four TDEs showed an optical brightening apart from the X-ray outburst. The other nine TDEs demonstrate no optical activity. All 13 TDEs are optically faint, with Lg/LX {\textless} 0.3 (Lg and LX being the g band and 0.2-6 keV luminosity, respectively). We have constructed a TDE X-ray luminosity function, which can be fit by a power law with a slope of -0.6 ± 0.2, similar to the trend observed for optically selected TDEs. The total rate is estimated at (1.1 ± 0.5) × 10-5 TDEs per galaxy per year, an order of magnitude lower than inferred from optical studies. This suggests that X-ray bright events constitute a minority of TDEs, consistent with models predicting that X-rays can only be observed from directions close to the axis of a thick accretion disc formed from the stellar debris. Our TDE detection threshold can be lowered by a factor of {\textasciitilde}2, which should allow a detection of {\textasciitilde}700 TDEs by the end of the SRG survey.},

	abstract = {We present a comprehensive optical and near-infrared census of the fields of 90 short gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) discovered in 2005-2021, constituting all short GRBs for which host galaxy associations are feasible (≈60\% of the total Swift short GRB population). We contribute 274 new multi-band imaging observations across 58 distinct GRBs and 26 spectra of their host galaxies. Supplemented by literature and archival survey data, the catalog contains 542 photometric and 42 spectroscopic data sets. The photometric catalog reaches 3σ depths of ≳24-27 mag and ≳23-26 mag for the optical and near-infrared bands, respectively. We identify host galaxies for 84 bursts, in which the most robust associations make up 56\% (50/90) of events, while only a small fraction, 6.7\%, have inconclusive host associations. Based on new spectroscopy, we determine 18 host spectroscopic redshifts with a range of z ≈ 0.15-1.5 and find that ≈23\%-41\% of Swift short GRBs originate from z {\textgreater} 1. We also present the galactocentric offset catalog for 84 short GRBs. Taking into account the large range of individual measurement uncertainties, we find a median of projected offset of ≈7.7 kpc, for which the bursts with the most robust associations have a smaller median of ≈4.8 kpc. Our catalog captures more high-redshift and low-luminosity hosts, and more highly offset bursts than previously found, thereby diversifying the population of known short GRB hosts and properties. In terms of locations and host luminosities, the populations of short GRBs with and without detectable extended emission are statistically indistinguishable. This suggests that they arise from the same progenitors, or from multiple progenitors, which form and evolve in similar environments. All of the data products are available on the Broadband Repository for Investigating Gamma-Ray Burst Host Traits website.},

	abstract = {We present a public catalog of transients from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) Bright Transient Survey, a magnitude-limited (m {\textless} 19 mag in either the g or r filter) survey for extragalactic transients in the ZTF public stream. We introduce cuts on survey coverage, sky visibility around peak light, and other properties unconnected to the nature of the transient, and show that the resulting statistical sample is spectroscopically 97\% complete at {\textless}18 mag, 93\% complete at {\textless}18.5 mag, and 75\% complete at {\textless}19 mag. We summarize the fundamental properties of this population, identifying distinct duration-luminosity correlations in a variety of supernova (SN) classes and associating the majority of fast optical transients with well-established spectroscopic SN types (primarily SN Ibn and II/IIb). We measure the Type Ia SN and core-collapse (CC) SN rates and luminosity functions, which show good consistency with recent work. About 7\% of CC SNe explode in very low-luminosity galaxies (Mi {\textgreater} -16 mag), 10\% in red-sequence galaxies, and 1\% in massive ellipticals. We find no significant difference in the luminosity or color distributions between the host galaxies of SNe Type II and SNe Type Ib/c, suggesting that line-driven wind stripping does not play a major role in the loss of the hydrogen envelope from their progenitors. Future large-scale classification efforts with ZTF and other wide-area surveys will provide high-quality measurements of the rates, properties, and environments of all known types of optical transients and limits on the existence of theoretically predicted but as yet unobserved explosions. * An interactive catalog with all data used in this paper is available at https://sites.astro.caltech.edu/ztf/bts and is updated in real time.},

We do not detect radio/millimeter emission from any of the sources, with the exception of a 6 GHz detection of PTF10hgi, as well as the detection of 6 GHz emission near the location of the SLSN PTF12dam, which we associate with its host galaxy. We use our data to place constraints on central engine emission due to magnetar wind nebulae and off-axis relativistic jets. We also explore nonrelativistic emission from the SN ejecta, and place constraints on obscured star formation in the host galaxies. In addition, we conduct a search for fast radio bursts (FRBs) from some of the sources using VLA phased-array observations; no FRBs are detected to a limit of 16 mJy (7σ; 10 ms duration) in about 40 minutes on source per event. A comparison to theoretical models suggests that continued radio monitoring may lead to detections of persistent radio emission on timescales of ≳ a decade.},

We verified the spectroscopic classification of each SLSN and collated an exhaustive data set of ultraviolet, optical, and infrared photometry totalling over 30 000 photometric detections. Using these data, we derive observational parameters such as the peak absolute magnitudes, rise and decline time-scales, as well as bolometric luminosities, temperature, and photospheric radius evolution for all SLSNe. Additionally, we model all light curves using a hybrid model that includes contributions from both a magnetar central engine and the radioactive decay of \${\textasciicircum}\{56\}\$Ni. We explore correlations among various physical and observational parameters, and recover the previously found relation between ejecta mass and magnetar spin, as well as the overall progenitor pre-explosion mass distribution with a peak at \${\textbackslash}approx 6.5\$ M\$\_{\textbackslash}odot\$. We find no significant redshift dependence for any parameter, and no evidence for distinct subtypes of SLSNe. We find that only a small fraction of SLSNe, \$ 3\$ per cent, are best fit with a significant radioactive decay component \$rsim 50\$ per cent. We provide several analytical tools designed to simulate typical SLSN light curves across a broad range of wavelengths and phases, enabling accurate K-corrections, bolometric scaling calculations, and inclusion of SLSNe in survey simulations or future comparison works.},

	abstract = {We present the results from a multiyear radio campaign of the superluminous supernova (SLSN) SN 2017ens, which yielded the earliest radio detection of an SLSN to date at the age of {\textasciitilde}3.3 yr after explosion. SN 2017ens was not detected at radio frequencies in the first {\textasciitilde}300 days but reached L ν ≈ 1028 erg s-1 cm-2 Hz-1 at ν {\textasciitilde} 6 GHz, {\textasciitilde}1250 days post explosion. Interpreting the radio observations in the context of synchrotron radiation from the supernova shock interaction with the circumstellar medium (CSM), we infer an effective mass-loss rate \${\textbackslash}dot\{M\}{\textbackslash}approx \{10\}{\textasciicircum}\{-4\}{\textbackslash},\{M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot \}{\textbackslash},\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{yr\}\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ at r {\textasciitilde} 1017 cm from the explosion's site, for a wind speed of v w = 50-60 km s-1 as measured from optical spectra. These findings are consistent with the spectroscopic metamorphosis of SN 2017ens from hydrogen poor to hydrogen rich {\textasciitilde}190 days after explosion reported by Chen et al. SN 2017ens is thus an addition to the sample of hydrogen-poor massive progenitors that explode shortly after having lost their hydrogen envelope. The inferred circumstellar densities, implying a CSM mass up to {\textasciitilde}0.5 M ☉, and low velocity of the ejection suggest that binary interactions (in the form of common-envelope evolution and subsequent envelope ejection) play a role in shaping the evolution of the stellar progenitors of SLSNe in the ≲500 yr preceding core collapse.},

Our Atacama Large Millimeter/Sub-millimeter Array (ALMA) detection of SGRB 211106A establishes an origin in a faint host galaxy detected in Hubble Space Telescope imaging at 0.7 ≲ z ≲ 1.4. From the lack of a detectable optical afterglow, coupled with the bright millimeter counterpart, we infer a high extinction, A V ≳ 2.6 mag along the line of sight, making this one of the most highly dust-extincted SGRBs known to date. The millimeter-band light curve captures the passage of the synchrotron peak from the afterglow forward shock and reveals a jet break at \{t\}\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{jet\}\}=\{29.2\}\_\{-4.0\}{\textasciicircum}\{+4.5\}\$ days. For a presumed redshift of z = 1, we infer an opening angle, θ jet = (15.°5 ± 1.°4), and beaming-corrected kinetic energy of {\textbackslash}mathrm\{log\}(\{E\}\_\{\{{\textbackslash}rm\{K\}\}\}/{\textbackslash}mathrm\{erg\})=51.8{\textbackslash}pm 0.3\$ , making this one of the widest and most energetic SGRB jets known to date. Combining all published millimeter-band upper limits in conjunction with the energetics for a large sample of SGRBs, we find that energetic outflows in high-density environments are more likely to have detectable millimeter counterparts. Concerted afterglow searches with ALMA should yield detection fractions of 24\%-40\% on timescales of ≳2 days at rates of ≈0.8-1.6 per year, outpacing the historical discovery rate of SGRB centimeter-band afterglows.},

	abstract = {GRB 221009A (z = 0.151) is one of the closest known long γ-ray bursts (GRBs). Its extreme brightness across all electromagnetic wavelengths provides an unprecedented opportunity to study a member of this still-mysterious class of transients in exquisite detail. We present multiwavelength observations of this extraordinary event, spanning 15 orders of magnitude in photon energy from radio to γ-rays. We find that the data can be partially explained by a forward shock (FS) from a highly collimated relativistic jet interacting with a low-density, wind-like medium. Under this model, the jet's beaming-corrected kinetic energy (E K {\textasciitilde} 4 × 1050 erg) is typical for the GRB population. The radio and millimeter data provide strong limiting constraints on the FS model, but require the presence of an additional emission component. From equipartition arguments, we find that the radio emission is likely produced by a small amount of mass (≲6 × 10-7 M ⊙) moving relativistically (Γ ≳ 9) with a large kinetic energy (≳1049 erg). However, the temporal evolution of this component does not follow prescriptions for synchrotron radiation from a single power-law distribution of electrons (e.g., in a reverse shock or two-component jet), or a thermal-electron population, perhaps suggesting that one of the standard assumptions of afterglow theory is violated. GRB 221009A will likely remain detectable with radio telescopes for years to come, providing a valuable opportunity to track the full lifecycle of a powerful relativistic jet.},

	abstract = {Tidal disruption events (TDEs) are highly energetic phenomena that occur when a star is tidally disrupted by the central massive black hole in a galaxy. Fitting the observed X-ray spectra of TDEs with a first-principles, general-relativistic slim-disk model for the emission from the inner accretion disk can constrain the black hole mass M • and dimensionless spin a •. Multiepoch spectra can break degeneracies in parameter estimation, particularly when they include a period of super-Eddington mass accretion. Even one observed super-Eddington epoch can be useful. Constraints on M •, a • improve as a power law with the number of spectral counts; the power-law index is higher for a higher mass accretion rate. These results are supported by the successful modeling of real spectra in the nearby (0.0206 ≤ z ≤ 0.145) TDEs ASASSN-14li, 3XMM J150052.0+015452, and 3XMM J215022.4–055108, which were observed over multiple epochs with {\textgreater}1 ks exposure times. Guided by these results, we create an updated and expanded TDE catalog from the Open TDE compilation. We then explore the XMM-Newton and Chandra archives to identify 37 TDE candidates with promising spectra for constraining M •, a • with slim-disk model fits. At least seven TDEs are likely associated with intermediate-mass black holes. Three of the 24 TDEs with multiepoch UV/optical photometry from Swift have late-time observations that allow their light curves to be compared directly to model predictions from the X-ray spectral fits. Existing X-ray spectra for other TDEs can be augmented with future optical/UV data. Ultimately, our new TDE catalog will reveal the M •, a • distributions traced by TDEs, thereby discriminating among black hole growth scenarios and providing insights on general relativity and dark matter particle candidates. The new TDE catalog is here: https://github.com/aarongoldtooth/Census-of-TDE-and-Archival-X-Ray-UV-Data/blob/main/Full\%20New\%20TDE\%20Catalog\%20(Published).tsv, and the codes used to construct it are here: https://github.com/aarongoldtooth/Census-of-TDE-and-Archival-X-Ray-UV-Data.},

	abstract = {We present the discovery of a nuclear transient with the Caltech–NRAO Stripe 82 Survey (CNSS), a dedicated radio transient survey carried out with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA). This transient, CNSS J001947.3+003527, exhibited a turn-on over a timescale of ≲1 yr, increasing in flux density at 3 GHz from {\textless}0.14 mJy in 2014 February to 4.4 ± 0.1 mJy in 2015 March, reaching a peak luminosity of around 2015 October. The association of CNSS J0019+00 with the nucleus (Gaia and our very-long baseline interferometry positions are consistent to within 1 pc) of a nearby S0 Seyfert galaxy at 77 Mpc, together with the radio spectral evolution, implies that this transient is most likely a tidal disruption event (TDE). Our equipartition analysis indicates the presence of a ∼15,000 km s−1 outflow, having energy ∼1049 erg. We derive the radial density profile for the circumnuclear material in the host galaxy to be proportional to R −2.5. All of these properties suggest resemblance with radio-detected thermal TDEs like ASASSN-14li and XMMSL1 J0740-85. No significant X-ray or optical emission is detected from CNSS J0019+00, although this may simply be due to the thermal emission being weak during our late-time follow-up observations. From the CNSS survey we have obtained the first unbiased measurement of the rate of radio TDEs, R({\textgreater}500μJy) of about 2 × 10−3 deg−2, or equivalently a volumetric rate of about 10 Gpc−3 yr−1. This rate implies that all-sky radio surveys such as the VLA Sky Survey and those planned with ASKAP, will find many tens of radio TDEs over the next few years.},

	abstract = {A tidal disruption event (TDE) takes place when a star passes near enough to a massive black hole to be disrupted. About half the star’s matter is given elliptical trajectories with large apocenter distances, and the other half is unbound. To form an accretion flow, the bound matter must lose a significant amount of energy, with the actual amount depending on the characteristic scale of the flow measured in units of the black hole’s gravitational radius (∼ \{\{10\}51\}\{\{(R/1000\{\{R\}g\})\}-1\} erg). Recent numerical simulations have revealed that the accretion flow scale is close to the scale of the most bound initial orbits, ∼ \{\{10\}3\}MBH,6.5-2/3\{\{R\}g\}∼ \{\{10\}15\}MBH,6.51/3 cm from the black hole, and the corresponding energy dissipation rate is ∼ \{\{10\}44\}MBH,6.5-1/6 erg s-1. We suggest that the energy liberated during the formation of the accretion disk, rather than the energy liberated by subsequent accretion onto the black hole, powers the observed optical TDE candidates. The observed rise times, luminosities, temperatures, emission radii, and line widths seen in these TDEs are all more readily explained in terms of heating associated with disk formation rather than in terms of accretion.},

	abstract = {We present a toy model for the thermal optical/UV/X-ray emission from tidal disruption events (TDEs). Motivated by recent hydrodynamical simulations, we assume that the debris streams promptly and rapidly circularize (on the orbital period of the most tightly bound debris), generating a hot quasi-spherical pressure-supported envelope of radius R v {\textasciitilde} 1014 cm (photosphere radius {\textasciitilde}1015 cm) surrounding the supermassive black hole (SMBH). As the envelope cools radiatively, it undergoes Kelvin-Helmholtz contraction R v ∝ t -1, its temperature rising T eff ∝ t 1/2 while its total luminosity remains roughly constant; the optical luminosity decays as \${\textbackslash}nu \{L\}\_\{{\textbackslash}nu \}{\textbackslash}propto {\textbackslash},\{R\}\_\{v\}{\textasciicircum}\{2\}\{T\}\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{eff\}\}{\textbackslash}propto \{t\}{\textasciicircum}\{-3/2\}\$ . Despite this similarity to the mass fallback rate \$\{{\textbackslash}dot\{M\}\}\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{fb\}\}{\textbackslash}propto \{t\}{\textasciicircum}\{-5/3\}\$ , envelope heating from fallback accretion is subdominant compared to the envelope cooling luminosity except near optical peak (where they are comparable). Envelope contraction can be delayed by energy injection from accretion from the inner envelope onto the SMBH in a regulated manner, leading to a late-time flattening of the optical/X-ray light curves, similar to those observed in some TDEs. Eventually, as the envelope contracts to near the circularization radius, the SMBH accretion rate rises to its maximum, in tandem with the decreasing optical luminosity. This cooling-induced (rather than circularization-induced) delay of up to several hundred days may account for the delayed onset of thermal X-rays, late-time radio flares, and high-energy neutrino generation, observed in some TDEs. We compare the model predictions to recent TDE light-curve correlation studies, finding both agreement and points of tension.},

	abstract = {AT 2022cmc is a recently documented tidal disruption event that exhibits a luminous jet, accompanied by fast-declining X-ray and long-lasting radio and millimeter emission. Motivated by the distinct spectral and temporal signatures between the X-ray and radio observations, we propose a multizone model involving relativistic jets with different Lorentz factors. We systematically study the evolution of faster and slower jets in an external density profile, considering the continuous energy injection rate associated with time-dependent accretion rates before and after the mass fallback time. We investigate time-dependent multiwavelength emission from both the forward shock (FS) and reverse shock (RS) regions of the fast and slow jets, in a self-consistent manner. Our analysis demonstrates that the energy injection rate can significantly impact the jet evolution and subsequently influence the lightcurves. We find that the X-ray spectra and lightcurves could be described by electron synchrotron emission from the RS of the faster jet, in which the late-time X-ray upper limits, extending to 400 days after the disruption, could be interpreted as a jet break. Meanwhile, the radio observations can be interpreted as a result of synchrotron emission from the FS region of the slower jet. We also discuss prospects for testing the model with current and future observations.},

	abstract = {Supermassive black holes disrupt passing stars, producing outbursts called tidal disruption events (TDEs). TDEs have recently gained attention due to their unique dynamics and emission processes, which are still not fully understood. Especially, the so-called optical TDEs are of interest as they often exhibit delayed or obscured X-ray emission from the accretion disc, making the origin of the prompt emission unclear. In this paper, we present multiband optical polarization observations and optical spectrometry of a recent TDE candidate AT 2022fpx, alongside monitoring observations in optical, ultraviolet, and X-rays. The optical spectra of AT 2022fpx show Bowen fluorescence as well as highly ionized iron emission lines, which are characteristic of extreme coronal line emitters. Additionally, the source exhibits variable but low-polarized continuum emission at the outburst peak, with a clear rotation of the polarization angle. X-ray emission observed approximately 250 d after the outburst peak in the decay appear flare-like but is consistent with constant temperature blackbody emission. The overall outburst decay is slower than for typical TDEs, and resembles more the ones seen from Bowen fluorescence flares. These observations suggest that AT 2022fpx could be a key source in linking different long-lived TDE scenarios. Its unique characteristics, such as extreme coronal line emission, variable polarization, and delayed X-ray flare, can be attributed to the outer shock scenario or a clumpy torus surrounding the supermassive black hole. Further studies, especially in the context of multiwavelength observations, are crucial to fully understand the dynamics and emission mechanisms of these intriguing astrophysical events.},

	abstract = {Stars in galactic centers are occasionally scattered so close to the central supermassive black hole that they are completely disrupted by tidal forces, initiating a transient accretion event. The aftermath of such a tidal disruption event (TDE) produces a bright-and-blue accretion flow which is known to persist for at least a decade (observationally) and can in principle produce ionizing radiation for hundreds of years. Tidal disruption events are known (observationally) to be overrepresented in galaxies which show extended emission line regions (EELRs), with no pre-TDE classical AGN activity, and to produce transient ``coronal lines'', such as [FeX] and [FeXIV]. Using coupled CLOUDY-TDE disk simulations we show that tidal disruption event disks produce a sufficient ionizing radiation flux over their lifetimes to power both EELR of radial extents of \$r {\textbackslash}sim 10{\textasciicircum}4\$ light years, and coronal lines. EELRs are produced when the ionizing radiation interacts with low density \$n\_H {\textbackslash}sim 10{\textasciicircum}1 - 10{\textasciicircum}3 {\textbackslash}, \{{\textbackslash}rm cm\}{\textasciicircum}\{-3\}\$ clouds on galactic scales, while coronal lines are produced by high density \$n\_H {\textbackslash}sim 10{\textasciicircum}6 - 10{\textasciicircum}8 {\textbackslash}, \{{\textbackslash}rm cm\}{\textasciicircum}\{-3\}\$ clouds near the galactic center. High density gas in galactic centers will also result in the rapid switching on of narrow line features in post-TDE galaxies, and also various high-ionization lines which may be observed throughout the infrared with JWST. Galaxies with a higher intrinsic rate of tidal disruption events will be more likely to show macroscopic EELRs, which can be traced to originate from the previous tidal disruption event in that galaxy, which naturally explains why TDEs are more likely to be discovered in galaxies with EELRs. We further argue that a non-negligible fraction of so-called optically selected ``AGN'' are tidal disruption events.},

Here we report the {\textbackslash}textit\{NICER\} discovery of QPEs in the optically-selected Tidal Disruption Event (TDE) and Extreme Coronal Line Emitter (ECLE) AT2022upj, exhibiting a large spread in recurrence times from 0.5-3.5 days, durations from 0.3-1 days, peak luminosities from \$10{\textasciicircum}\{42.5-43.0\}\$ erg s\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$, and erratic flare profiles. A wealth of evidence now links at least some QPEs to the newly-formed accretion flows emerging from TDEs; AT2022upj is the third QPE reported in an optically discovered TDE. Marginalizing over the uncertain distributions of QPE peak luminosity, recurrence time, delay after TDE peak, and lifetime, we use the burgeoning sample to make a Bayesian estimate that the fraction of optical TDEs resulting in QPEs within 5 years post-disruption is \$9{\textasciicircum}\{+9\}\_\{-5\}\${\textbackslash}\%. Along with AT2019qiz, AT2022upj also marks the second of the three optical TDE+X-ray QPEs showing coronal line emission, suggesting ECLEs may represent a subset of TDEs particularly efficient at forming QPEs and/or that sustained QPE X-ray emission contributes to coronal line emission in some galaxy nuclei.},

	abstract = {Extreme coronal line emitters (ECLEs) are a rare class of galaxy that exhibit strong, high-ionization iron coronal emission lines in their spectra. In some cases, these lines are transient and may be the result of tidal disruption event (TDEs). To test this connection, we calculate the rate of variable ECLEs (vECLEs) at redshift \${\textbackslash}sim0.3\$. We search for ECLEs in the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) LOWZ sample and discover two candidate ECLEs. Using follow-up spectra from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument and Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph, and mid-infrared observations from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, we determine that one of these galaxies is a vECLE. Using this galaxy, we calculate the galaxy-normalized vECLE rate at redshift \${\textbackslash}sim0.3\$ to be \$R\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{G\}=1.6{\textasciitilde}{\textasciicircum}\{+3.8\}\_\{-1.4\}{\textbackslash}times10{\textasciicircum}\{-6\}{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}mathrm\{galaxy\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}mathrm\{yr\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ and the mass-normalized rate to be \$R\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{M\}=7{\textasciitilde}{\textasciicircum}\{+16\}\_\{-6\}{\textbackslash}times10{\textasciicircum}\{-18\}{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}mathrm\{M\_{\textbackslash}odot{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\}{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}mathrm\{yr\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$.

Formally, the LOWZ vECLE rates are \$2-4\$ times lower than the rates calculated from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Legacy sample at redshift \${\textbackslash}sim0.1\$. However, given the large uncertainties on both measurements, they are consistent with each other at \$1{\textbackslash}sigma\$. Both the galaxy-normalized and volumetric rates are one to two orders of magnitude lower than TDE rates from the literature, consistent with vECLEs being caused by \$5-20\$ per cent of all TDEs.},

AT 2018dyk has sparked a debate in the literature around its classification as either a bona-fide TDE or as an active galactic nucleus (AGN) turn-on state change. A new follow-up spectrum taken with the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument, in combination with host-galaxy analysis using archival SDSS-MaNGA data, supports the identification of AT 2018dyk as a TDE. Specifically, we classify this object as a TDE that occurred within a gas-rich environment, which was responsible for both its mid-infrared (MIR) outburst and development of Fe coronal emission lines. Comparison with the known sample of TDE-linked extreme coronal line emitters (TDE-ECLEs) and other TDEs displaying coronal emission lines (CrL-TDEs) reveals similar characteristics and shared properties. For example, the MIR properties of both groups appear to form a continuum with links to the content and density of the material in their local environments. This includes evidence for a MIR colour-luminosity relationship in TDEs occurring within such gas-rich environments, with those with larger MIR outbursts also exhibiting redder peaks.},

	abstract = {We present fresh insights into the nature of the tidal disruption event (TDE) candidate AT 2018dyk. AT 2018dyk has sparked a debate in the literature around its classification as either a bona-fide TDE or as an active galactic nucleus (AGN) turn-on state change. A new follow-up spectrum taken with the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument, in combination with host-galaxy analysis using archival SDSS-MaNGA data, supports the identification of AT 2018dyk as a TDE. Specifically, we classify this object as a TDE that occurred within a gas-rich environment, which was responsible for both its mid-infrared (MIR) outburst and development of Fe coronal emission lines. Comparison with the known sample of TDE-linked extreme coronal line emitters (TDE-ECLEs) and other TDEs displaying coronal emission lines (CrL-TDEs) reveals similar characteristics and shared properties. For example, the MIR properties of both groups appear to form a continuum with links to the content and density of the material in their local environments. This includes evidence for a MIR colour-luminosity relationship in TDEs occurring within such gas-rich environments, with those with larger MIR outbursts also exhibiting redder peaks.},

	abstract = {We present analytic approximations to the optically thin synchrotron and synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) spectra when Klein-Nishina (KN) effects are important and pair production and external radiation fields can be neglected. This theory is useful for analytical treatment of radiation from astrophysical sources, such as gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), active galactic nuclei, and pulsar wind nebula, where KN effects may be important. We consider a source with continuous injection of relativistic electrons with a power-law energy distribution above some typical injection energy. We find that the synchrotron-SSC spectra can be described by a broken power law, and provide analytic estimates for the break frequencies and power-law indices. In general, we show that the dependence of the KN cross section on the energy of the upscattering electron results in a hardening of the energy distribution of fast cooling electrons and therefore in a hardening of the observed synchrotron spectrum. As a result the synchrotron spectrum of fast cooling electrons, below the typical injection energy, can be as hard as F ν vprop ν0, instead of the classical ν-1/2 when KN effects are neglected. The synchrotron energy output can be dominated by electrons with energy above the typical injection energy. We solve self-consistently for the cooling frequency and find that the transition between synchrotron and SSC cooling can result in discontinuous variations of the cooling frequency and the synchrotron and SSC spectra. We demonstrate the application of our results to theory by applying them to prompt and afterglow emission models of GRBs.},

	abstract = {At 66 Mpc, AT2019qiz is the closest optical tidal disruption event (TDE) to date, with a luminosity intermediate between the bulk of the population and the faint-and-fast event iPTF16fnl. Its proximity allowed a very early detection and triggering of multiwavelength and spectroscopic follow-up well before maximum light. The velocity dispersion of the host galaxy and fits to the TDE light curve indicate a black hole mass ≈106 M⊙, disrupting a star of ≈1 M⊙. By analysing our comprehensive UV, optical, and X-ray data, we show that the early optical emission is dominated by an outflow, with a luminosity evolution L ∝ t2, consistent with a photosphere expanding at constant velocity (≳2000 km s-1), and a line-forming region producing initially blueshifted H and He II profiles with v = 3000-10 000 km s-1. The fastest optical ejecta approach the velocity inferred from radio detections (modelled in a forthcoming companion paper from K. D. Alexander et al.), thus the same outflow may be responsible for both the fast optical rise and the radio emission - the first time this connection has been observed in a TDE. The light-curve rise begins 29 ± 2 d before maximum light, peaking when the photosphere reaches the radius where optical photons can escape. The photosphere then undergoes a sudden transition, first cooling at constant radius then contracting at constant temperature. At the same time, the blueshifts disappear from the spectrum and Bowen fluorescence lines (N III) become prominent, implying a source of far-UV photons, while the X-ray light curve peaks at ≈1041 erg s-1. Assuming that these X-rays are from prompt accretion, the size and mass of the outflow are consistent with the reprocessing layer needed to explain the large optical to X-ray ratio in this and other optical TDEs, possibly favouring accretion-powered over collision-powered outflow models.},

Broadband afterglow observations, spanning from X-ray to radio frequencies, provide a probe of the density structure of the circumburst medium, as well as of the ejecta energetics, geometry, and physical parameters of the relativistic blast wave resulting from the explosion. We present an analysis of Chandra X-Ray Observatory observations of this event, along with Hubble Space Telescope and radio monitoring data. We combine these data with ground-based optical and IR observations and fit the synthesized afterglow light curve using models where collimated ejecta expand into a surrounding medium. We find that we can explain the broadband light curve with reasonable physical parameters if the cooling is dominated by inverse Compton scattering. For this model, an excess due to inverse Compton scattering appears above the best-fit synchrotron spectrum in the X-ray band. No previous bursts have exhibited this component, and its observation would imply that the GRB exploded in a moderately dense (n{\textasciitilde}30 cm-3) medium, consistent with a diffuse interstellar cloud environment.},

	abstract = {Beaming of relativistic ejecta in gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) has been postulated by many authors in order to reduce the total GRB energy; thus it is very important to look for the observational evidence of beaming. Rhoads has pointed out recently that the dynamics of the blast wave, which is formed when the beamed ejecta sweep the external medium, will be significantly modified by the sideways expansion caused by the increased swept-up matter. He has claimed that shortly after the bulk Lorentz factor (Γ) of the blast wave drops below the inverse of the initial opening angle (θ0) of the beamed ejecta, there will be a sharp break in the afterglow light curves. However, some other authors have performed numerical calculations and shown that the break of the light curve is weaker and much smoother than the one analytically predicted. In this paper we reanalyze the dynamical evolution of the jet blast wave and calculate the jet emission analytically; we find that the sharp break predicted by Rhoads will actually not exist, and for most cases the afterglow light curve will be almost unaffected by sideways expansion unless the beaming angle is extremely small. We demonstrate that only when θ0{\textless}0.1 may the afterglow light curves be steepened by sideways expansion, and in fact there cannot be two breaks as claimed before. We have also constructed a simple numerical code to verify our conclusion.},

	abstract = {We present a comprehensive multiwavelength analysis of the bright, long-duration gamma-ray burst GRB 070125, comprised of observations in gamma-ray, X-ray, optical, millimeter, and centimeter wave bands. Simultaneous fits to the optical and X-ray light curves favor a break on day 3.78, which we interpret as the jet break from a collimated outflow. Independent fits to optical and X-ray bands give similar results in the optical bands but shift the jet break to around day 10 in the X-ray light curve. We show that for the physical parameters derived for GRB 070125, inverse Compton scattering effects are important throughout the afterglow evolution. While inverse Compton scattering does not affect radio and optical bands, it may be a promising candidate to delay the jet break in the X-ray band. Radio light curves show rapid flux variations, which are interpreted as due to interstellar scintillation and used to derive an upper limit of 2.4 × 1017 cm on the radius of the fireball in the lateral expansion phase of the jet. Radio light curves and spectra suggest a high synchrotron self-absorption frequency indicative of the afterglow shock wave moving in a dense medium. Our broadband modeling favors a constant density profile for the circumburst medium over a windlike profile (R-2). However, keeping in mind the uncertainty of the parameters, it is difficult to unambiguously distinguish between the two density profiles. Our broadband fits suggest that GRB 070125 is a burst with high radiative efficiency ({\textgreater}60\%).},

	abstract = {Chandra X-ray observations of the nearby brightest cluster galaxy M87 resolve the hot gas structure across the Bondi accretion radius of the central supermassive black hole (SMBH), a measurement possible in only a handful of systems but complicated by the bright nucleus and jet emission. By stacking only short frame-time observations to limit pileup, and after subtracting the nuclear point spread function, we analysed the X-ray gas properties within the Bondi radius at 0.12-0.22 kpc (1.5-2.8 arcsec), depending on the black hole mass. Within 2 kpc radius, we detect two significant temperature components, which are consistent with constant values of 2 and 0.9 keV down to 0.15 kpc radius. No evidence was found for the expected temperature increase within ∼ 0.25 kpc due to the influence of the SMBH. Within the Bondi radius, the density profile is consistent with ρ ∝ r−1. The lack of a temperature increase inside the Bondi radius suggests that the hot gas structure is not dictated by the SMBH's potential and, together with the shallow density profile, shows that the classical Bondi rate may not reflect the accretion rate on to the SMBH. If this density profile extends in towards the SMBH, the mass accretion rate on to the SMBH could be at least two orders of magnitude less than the Bondi rate, which agrees with Faraday rotation measurements for M87. We discuss the evidence for outflow from the hot gas and the cold gas disc and for cold feedback, where gas cooling rapidly from the hot atmosphere could feed the cirumnuclear disc and fuel the SMBH. At 0.2 kpc radius, the cooler X-ray temperature component represents ∼20 per cent of the total X-ray gas mass and, by losing angular momentum to the hot gas component, could provide a fuel source of cold clouds within the Bondi radius.},

X-ray observations resolving the Bondi radius yield an estimate roughly four orders of magnitude further out. Here, we present a new, indirect measurement of the accretion flow density at intermediate radii. We use the dynamics of the gas cloud G2 to probe the ambient density. We detect the presence of a drag force slowing down G2 with a statistical significance of ≈9σ. This probes the accretion flow density at around 1000 Schwarzschild radii and yields a number density of ≈4 × 103 cm−3.

	abstract = {We present the discovery of a nuclear transient with the Caltech–NRAO Stripe 82 Survey (CNSS), a dedicated radio transient survey carried out with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA). This transient, CNSS J001947.3+003527, exhibited a turn-on over a timescale of ≲1 yr, increasing in flux density at 3 GHz from {\textless}0.14 mJy in 2014 February to 4.4 ± 0.1 mJy in 2015 March, reaching a peak luminosity of around 2015 October. The association of CNSS J0019+00 with the nucleus (Gaia and our very-long baseline interferometry positions are consistent to within 1 pc) of a nearby S0 Seyfert galaxy at 77 Mpc, together with the radio spectral evolution, implies that this transient is most likely a tidal disruption event (TDE). Our equipartition analysis indicates the presence of a ∼15,000 km s−1 outflow, having energy ∼1049 erg. We derive the radial density profile for the circumnuclear material in the host galaxy to be proportional to R −2.5. All of these properties suggest resemblance with radio-detected thermal TDEs like ASASSN-14li and XMMSL1 J0740-85. No significant X-ray or optical emission is detected from CNSS J0019+00, although this may simply be due to the thermal emission being weak during our late-time follow-up observations. From the CNSS survey we have obtained the first unbiased measurement of the rate of radio TDEs, R({\textgreater}500μJy) of about 2 × 10−3 deg−2, or equivalently a volumetric rate of about 10 Gpc−3 yr−1. This rate implies that all-sky radio surveys such as the VLA Sky Survey and those planned with ASKAP, will find many tens of radio TDEs over the next few years.},

	abstract = {A tidal disruption event (TDE) occurs when a star is destroyed by a supermassive black hole. Broad-band radio spectral observations of TDEs trace the emission from any outflows or jets that are ejected from the vicinity of the supermassive black hole. However, radio detections of TDEs are rare, with {\textless}20 published to date, and only 11 with multi-epoch broad-band coverage. Here we present the radio detection of the TDE AT2020vwl and our subsequent radio monitoring campaign of the outflow that was produced, spanning 1.5 yr post-optical flare. We tracked the outflow evolution as it expanded between 1016 and 1017 cm from the supermassive black hole, deducing it was non-relativistic and launched quasi-simultaneously with the initial optical detection through modelling the evolving synchrotron spectra of the event. We deduce that the outflow is likely to have been launched by material ejected from stream-stream collisions (more likely), the unbound debris stream, or an accretion-induced wind or jet from the supermassive black hole (less likely). AT2020vwl joins a growing number of TDEs with well-characterized prompt radio emission, with future timely radio observations of TDEs required to fully understand the mechanism that produces this type of radio emission in TDEs.},

	abstract = {Tidal disruption events (TDEs) occur when a star passes too close to a supermassive black hole and is destroyed by tidal gravitational forces. Radio observations of TDEs trace synchrotron emission from outflowing material that may be ejected from the inner regions of the accretion flow around the supermassive black hole or by the tidal debris stream. Radio detections of TDEs are rare, but provide crucial information about the launching of jets and outflows from supermassive black holes and the circumnuclear environment in galaxies. Here, we present the radio detection of the TDE AT2020opy, including three epochs of radio observations taken with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array, MeerKAT, and upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio telescope. AT2020opy is the most distant thermal TDE with radio emission reported to date, and from modelling the evolving synchrotron spectra we deduce that the host galaxy has a more dense circumnuclear medium than other thermal TDEs detected in the radio band. Based on an equipartition analysis of the synchrotron spectral properties of the event, we conclude that the radio-emitting outflow was likely launched approximately at the time of, or just after, the initial optical flare. We find no evidence for relativistic motion of the outflow. The high luminosity of this event supports that a dense circumnuclear medium of the host galaxy produces brighter radio emission that rises to a peak more quickly than in galaxies with lower central densities.},

	abstract = {We present an analysis of Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS)/Hubble Space Telescope optical spectra of a sample of 10 Seyfert galaxies aimed at studying the structure and physical properties of the coronal-line region (CLR). The high spatial resolution provided by STIS allowed us to resolve the CLR and obtain key information about the kinematics of the CL gas, measure directly its spatial scale, and study the mechanisms that drive the high-ionization lines. We find CLRs extending from just a few parsecs ( pc) up to 230 pc in radius, consistent with the bulk of the coronal lines (CLs) originating between the broad-line region and narrow-line region (NLR), and extending into the NLR in the case of [Fe vii] and [Ne v] lines. The CL profiles strongly vary with the distance to the nucleus. We observed line splitting in the core of some of the galaxies. Line peak shifts, both redshift and blueshift, typically reached 500 km s−1, and even higher velocities (1000 km s−1) in some of the galaxies. In general, CLs follow the same pattern of rotation curves as low-ionization lines like [O iii]. From a direct comparison between the radio and the CL emission we find that neither the strength nor the kinematics of the CLs scales in any obvious and strong way with the radio jets. Moreover, the similarity of the flux distributions and kinematics of the CLs and low-ionization lines, the low temperatures derived for the gas, and the success of photoionization models to reproduce, within a factor of a few, the observed line ratios, point towards photoionization as the main driving mechanism of CLs.},

We show that the outflow was ejected on 2014 August 11-25, in agreement with an independent estimate of the timing of super-Eddington accretion based on the optical, ultraviolet, and X-ray observations, and that the ejected mass corresponds to about 1\%-10\% of the mass accreted in the super-Eddington phase. The temporal evolution of the radio emission also uncovers the circumnuclear density profile, ρ (R){\textbackslash}propto \{R\}{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-2.5{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} on a scale of about 0.01 pc, a scale that cannot be probed via direct measurements even in the nearest supermassive black holes. Our discovery of radio emission from the nearest well-studied TDE to date, with a radio luminosity lower than all previous limits, indicates that non-relativistic outflows are ubiquitous in TDEs, and that future, more sensitive, radio surveys will uncover similar events.},

The data were obtained with the EVLA, AMI Large Array, CARMA, the SMA, and the VLBA+Effelsberg as part of a long-term program to monitor the expansion and energy scale of the relativistic outflow, and to trace the parsec-scale environment around a previously dormant supermassive black hole (SMBH). The new observations reveal a significant change in the radio evolution starting at δt ≈ 1 month, with a brightening at all frequencies that requires an increase in the energy by about an order of magnitude, and an overall density profile around the SMBH of ρvpropr -3/2 (0.1-1.2 pc) with a significant flattening at r ≈ 0.4-0.6 pc. The increase in energy cannot be explained with continuous injection from an Lvpropt -5/3 tail, which is observed in the X-rays. Instead, we conclude that the relativistic jet was launched with a wide range of Lorentz factors, obeying E({\textgreater} Γ j )vpropΓ-2.5 j . The similar ratios of duration to dynamical timescale for Sw 1644+57 and gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) suggest that this result may be applicable to GRB jets as well. The radial density profile may be indicative of Bondi accretion, with the inferred flattening at r {\textasciitilde} 0.5 pc in good agreement with the Bondi radius for a {\textasciitilde}few × 106 M ⊙ black hole. The density at {\textasciitilde}0.5 pc is about a factor of 30 times lower than inferred for the Milky Way Galactic Center, potentially due to a smaller number of mass-shedding massive stars. From our latest observations (δt ≈ 216 days) we find that the jet energy is E j, iso ≈ 5 × 1053 erg (Ej ≈ 2.4 × 1051 erg for θ j = 0.1), the radius is r ≈ 1.2 pc, the Lorentz factor is Γ j ≈ 2.2, the ambient density is n ≈ 0.2 cm-3, and the projected angular size is r proj ≈ 25 μas, below the resolution of the VLBA+Effelsberg. Assuming no future changes in the observed evolution and a final integrated total energy of Ej ≈ 1052 erg, we predict that the radio emission from Sw 1644+57 should be detectable with the EVLA for several decades and will be resolvable with very long baseline interferometry in a few years.},

We find that the X-ray emission has faded below detectable levels, with an upper limit of ≲3.5 × 10-15 erg cm-2 s-1 in a 100 ks observation, while the radio emission continues to be detected and steadily fade. Both are consistent with forward shock emission from a non-relativistic outflow, although we find that the radio spectral energy distribution is better fit at these late times with an electron power-law index of p ≈ 3 (as opposed to p ≈ 2.5 at earlier times). With the revised spectral index we find ɛB ≈ 0.01 using the radio and X-ray data, and a density of ≈0.04 cm3 at a radius of R ≈ 0.65 pc (Rsch ≈ 2 × 106 R⊙) from the black hole. The energy scale of the blastwave is ≈1052 erg. We also report detections of Sw 1644+57 at 3 GHz from the first two epochs of the VLA Sky Survey (VLASS), and find that ∼102 off-axis Sw 1644+57-like events to z ∼ 0.5 may be present in the VLASS data. Finally, we find that Sw 1644+57 itself will remain detectable for decades at radio frequencies, although observations at sub-GHz frequencies will become increasingly important to characterize its dynamical evolution.},

The data were obtained with the JVLA and AMI Large Array as part of our on-going study of the jet energetics and the density structure of the parsec-scale environment around the disrupting supermassive black hole. We combine these data with public Swift/XRT and Chandra X-ray observations over the same time-frame to show that the jet has undergone a dramatic transition starting at ≈500 days, with a sharp decline in the X-ray flux by about a factor of 170 on a timescale of δt/t {\textless}{\textasciitilde} 0.2 (and by a factor of 15 in δt/t ≈ 0.05). The rapid decline rules out a forward shock origin (direct or reprocessing) for the X-ray emission at {\textless}{\textasciitilde} 500 days, and instead points to internal dissipation in the inner jet. On the other hand, our radio data uniquely demonstrate that the low X-ray flux measured by Chandra at ≈610 days is consistent with emission from the forward shock. Furthermore, the Chandra data are inconsistent with thermal emission from the accretion disk itself since the expected temperature of {\textasciitilde}30-60 eV and inner radius of {\textasciitilde}2-10 Rs cannot accommodate the observed flux level or the detected emission at {\textgreater}{\textasciitilde} 1 keV. We associate the rapid decline with a turn off of the relativistic jet when the mass accretion rate dropped below ∼{\textbackslash}dot\{M\}\_Edd ≈ 0.006 M ⊙ yr-1 (for a 3 × 106 M ⊙ black hole and order unity efficiency) indicating that the peak accretion rate was about 330 {\textbackslash}dot\{M\}\_Edd, and the total accreted mass by t ≈ 500 days is about 0.15 M ⊙. From the radio data we further find significant flattening in the integrated energy of the forward shock at t {\textgreater}{\textasciitilde} 250 days with E j, iso ≈ 2 × 1054 erg (Ej ≈ 1052 erg for a jet opening angle, θ j = 0.1) following a rise by about a factor of 15 at ≈30-250 days.

	abstract = {Active galactic nuclei, which are powered by long-term accretion onto central supermassive black holes, produce relativistic jets with lifetimes of at least one million years, and the observation of the birth of such a jet is therefore unlikely. Transient accretion onto a supermassive black hole, for example through the tidal disruption of a stray star, thus offers a rare opportunity to study the birth of a relativistic jet. On 25 March 2011, an unusual transient source (Swift J164449.3+573451) was found, potentially representing such an accretion event. Here we report observations spanning centimetre to millimetre wavelengths and covering the first month of evolution of a luminous radio transient associated with Swift J164449.3+573451. The radio transient coincides with the nucleus of an inactive galaxy. We conclude that we are seeing a newly formed relativistic outflow, launched by transient accretion onto a million-solar-mass black hole. A relativistic outflow is not predicted in this situation, but we show that the tidal disruption of a star naturally explains the observed high-energy properties and radio luminosity and the inferred rate of such events. The weaker beaming in the radio-frequency spectrum relative to γ-rays or X-rays suggests that radio searches may uncover similar events out to redshifts of z{\textasciitilde}6.},

Yet this luminous flare can be reprocessed by gas or dust that inhabits a galactic nucleus, resulting in multiple reverberation signals. Nuclear dust heated by the TDE will lead to an echo at infrared wavelengths (1-10 μm) and transient coronal lines in optical spectra of TDEs trace reverberation by gas that orbits the black hole. Both of these signal have been detected, here we review this rapidly developing field. We also review the results that have been extracted from TDEs with high-quality X-ray light curves: quasi periodic oscillations (QPOs), reverberation lags of fluorescence lines, and cross-correlations with emission at other wavelengths. The observational techniques that are covered in this review probe the emission from TDEs over a wide range of scales: from ∼1 light year to the innermost parts of the newly formed accretion disk. They provide insights into important properties of TDEs such as their bolometric output and the geometry of the accretion flow. While reverberation signals are not detected for every TDE, we anticipate they will become more commonplace when the next generation of X-ray and infrared instruments become operational.},

	abstract = {A tidal disruption event (TDE) of a star by a massive black hole yields a short and luminous flare of radiation, thus providing a unique signpost of otherwise dormant black holes. While the detection rate of optical TDEs is accelerating, our understanding of their optical emission has hit a formidable obstacle: the missing energy problem. The observed electromagnetic output of TDEs is almost four orders of magnitude lower than the gravitational potential energy that must be released when a star is accreted. This missing energy could either be emitted over a much longer timescale than the optical flare, or it could be emitted promptly but in the extreme-UV band. Discriminating between these two models will be required to unlock TDEs as tools for black hole demographics. Fortunately, the infrared reverberation signal from dust heated by a TDE can be used to measure the total energy of the event. These TDE dust echoes have recently been discovered, however their use as bolometers requires a much better measurement of the dust temperature and composition. JWST is ideally suited to make these observations. With a sequence of spectroscopic observations triggered on an IR-bright TDE, we will measure the dust grain sublimation rate by comparing the nuclear hot dust spectrum to its pristine off-nuclear state. And because circumnuclear dust in TDEs is suddenly exposed to UV radiation we will also constrain the grain properties via the temporal variability of the emission lines. These observations will yield the first-ever infrared spectra of a TDE, allowing us to solve the missing energy problem and measure the dust covering factor at sub-parsec scales.},

We find that the re-brightening feature in the radio light curve can be naturally explained by the two-component jet model. The possible origin of this structured jet are the Blandford-Znajek and Blandford-Payne mechanisms. We also show that this two-component jet model can interpret the two kinds of quasi-periodic variations in the X-ray light curve: a 200 second quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) and a 2.7-day quasi-periodic variation. The latter is interpreted by a precessing outer jet launched near the Bardeen-Petterson radius of a warped disk. The \${\textbackslash}sim\$ 200s QPO could be associated with a second, narrower jet sweeping the observer line-of-sight periodically, which is launched from a spinning black hole in the misaligned direction with respect to the black hole's angular momentum.},

	abstract = {We present continued radio and X-ray observations of the relativistic tidal disruption event Swift J164449.3+573451 extending to δt ≈ 2000 days after discovery. The radio data were obtained with the Very Large Array (VLA) as part of a long-term program to monitor the energy and dynamical evolution of the jet and to characterize the parsec-scale environment around a previously dormant supermassive black hole. We combine these data with Chandra observations and demonstrate that the X-ray emission following the sharp decline at δt ≈ 500 days is likely due to the forward shock. We constrain the synchrotron cooling frequency and the microphysical properties of the outflow for the first time. We find that the cooling frequency evolves through the optical/NIR band at δt ≈ 10-200 days, corresponding to ɛ B ≈ 10-3, well below equipartition; the X-ray data demonstrate that this deviation from equipartition holds to at least δt ≈ 2000 days. We thus recalculate the physical properties of the jet over the lifetime of the event, no longer assuming equipartition. We find a total kinetic energy of E K ≈ 4 × 1051 erg and a transition to non-relativistic expansion on the timescale of our latest observations (700 days). The density profile is approximately R -3/2 at ≲0.3 pc and ≳0.7 pc, with a plateau at intermediate scales, characteristic of Bondi accretion. Based on its evolution thus far, we predict that Sw 1644+57 will be detectable at centimeter wavelengths for decades to centuries with existing and upcoming radio facilities. Similar off-axis events should be detectable to z ∼ 2, but with a slow evolution that may inhibit their recognition as transient events.},

The bolometric light curve, the blackbody temperature and radius, the broad H and He i λ5876 emission lines and their evolution with time, are all consistent with a tidal disruption event (TDE) nature. A soft X-ray flare is detected with a delay of ∼200 d with respect to the optical/UV peak and it is rapidly followed by the emergence of a broad He ii λ4686 and by a number of long-lasting high ionization coronal emission lines. This indicate a clear connection between a TDE flare and the appearance of extreme coronal line emission (ECLEs). An IR echo, resulting from dust re-radiation of the optical/UV TDE light is observed after the X-ray flare and the associated near-IR spectra show a transient broad feature in correspondence of the He i λ10830 and, for the first time in a TDE, a transient high-ionization coronal NIR line (the [Fe xiii] λ10798) is also detected. The data are well explained by a scenario in which a TDE occurs in a gas-and-dust rich environment and its optical/UV, soft X-ray, and IR emission have different origins and locations. The optical emission may be produced by stellar debris stream collisions prior to the accretion disc formation, which is instead responsible for the soft X-ray flare, emitted after the end of the circularization process.},

	abstract = {We present late-time radio/millimeter (as well as optical/UV and X-ray) detections of tidal disruption event (TDE) AT2018hyz, spanning 970-1300 d after optical discovery. In conjunction with earlier deeper limits, including those at ≈700 days, our observations reveal rapidly rising emission at 0.8-240 GHz, steeper than F ν ∝ t 5 relative to the time of optical discovery. Such a steep rise cannot be explained in any reasonable scenario of an outflow launched at the time of disruption (e.g., off-axis jet, sudden increase in the ambient density), and instead points to a delayed launch. Our multifrequency data allow us to directly determine the radius and energy of the radio-emitting outflow, and we find from our modeling that the outflow was launched ≈750 days after optical discovery. The outflow velocity is mildly relativistic, with β ≈ 0.25 and ≈0.6 for a spherical geometry and a 10° jet geometry, respectively, and the minimum kinetic energy is E K ≈ 5.8 × 1049 and ≈6.3 × 1049 erg, respectively. This is the first definitive evidence for the production of a delayed mildly relativistic outflow in a TDE; a comparison to the recently published radio light curve of ASASSN-15oi suggests that the final rebrightening observed in that event (at a single frequency and time) may be due to a similar outflow with a comparable velocity and energy. Finally, we note that the energy and velocity of the delayed outflow in AT2018hyz are intermediate between those of past nonrelativistic TDEs (e.g., ASASSN-14li, AT2019dsg) and the relativistic TDE Sw J1644+57. We suggest that such delayed outflows may be common in TDEs.},

Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) and the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), and spanning 55-560 days post disruption. We find that the peak brightness of the radio emission increases until {\textasciitilde}200 days and subsequently begins to decrease steadily. Using a standard equipartition analysis, including the effects of synchrotron cooling as determined by the joint VLA-ALMA spectral energy distributions, we find that the outflow powering the radio emission is in roughly free expansion with a velocity of ≈0.07 c, while its kinetic energy increases by a factor of about 5 from 55 to 200 days and plateaus at ≈4.4 × 1048 erg thereafter. The ambient density traced by the outflow declines as radius ≈R-1.7 on a scale of ≈(1-4) × 1016 cm (≈6300-25,000 Rs), followed by a steeper decline to ≈7 × 1016 cm (≈44,000 Rs). Allowing for a collimated geometry, we find that to reach even mildly relativistic velocities (Γ = 2) the outflow requires an opening angle of θj ≈ 2°, which is narrow even by the standards of gamma-ray burst jets; a truly relativistic outflow requires an unphysically narrow jet. The outflow velocity and kinetic energy in AT2019dsg are typical of previous non-relativistic TDEs, and comparable to those from type Ib/c supernovae, raising doubts about the claimed association with a high-energy neutrino event.},

We find that ASASSN-19bt displays unusual radio evolution compared to other TDEs, as the peak brightness of its radio emission increases rapidly until 457 days post-optical discovery and then plateaus. Using a generalized approach to standard equipartition techniques, we estimate the energy and corresponding physical parameters for two possible emission geometries: a nonrelativistic spherical outflow and a relativistic outflow observed from a range of viewing angles. We find that the nonrelativistic solution implies a continuous energy rise in the outflow from E ∼ 1046 to E ∼ 1049 erg with outflow speed β ≈ 0.05, while the off-axis relativistic jet solution instead suggests E ≈ 1052 erg with Lorentz factor Γ ∼ 10 at late times in the maximally off-axis case. We find that neither model provides a holistic explanation for the origin and evolution of the radio emission, emphasizing the need for more complex models. ASASSN-19bt joins the population of TDEs that display unusual radio emission at late times. Conducting long-term radio observations of these TDEs, especially during the later phases, will be crucial for understanding how these types of radio emission in TDEs are produced.},

LTs in astronomy are post-lecture activities developed with the intention of helping students engage with conceptual and reasoning difficulties around a specific topic with the end goal of them developing a more expert-like understanding of astrophysical concepts. To date, all astronomy LTs have been developed for undergraduate courses taught in-person. Increases in online course enrollments and the COVID-19 pandemic further highlighted the need for additional interactive, research-based, curricular materials designed for online classrooms. To this end, we developed and assessed the efficacy of an innovative, interactive LT designed to teach planet formation in asynchronous, online, introductory astronomy courses for undergraduates. We utilized the Planet Formation Concept Inventory to compare learning outcomes between courses that implemented the new online, interactive LT, and those that used either a lecture-only approach or utilized a standard pencil-and-paper LT on the same topic. Overall, learning gains from the standard pencil-and-paper LT were statistically indistinguishable from the in-person implementation of the online LT and both of these conditions outperformed the lecture-only condition. However, when implemented asynchronously, learning gains from the online LT were lower and not significantly above the lecture-only condition. While improvements can be made to improve the online LT in the future, the current discipline ideas still outperform traditional lecture, and can be used as a tool to teach planet formation effectively.},

These efforts motivated and informed the development of two frameworks: (1) a curriculum characterization framework that allows us to systematically code active learning strategies in terms of the discipline representations, intellectual tasks, and reasoning complexity that an activity offers the learner; and (2) a curriculum development framework that guides the development of activities deliberately focused on increasing learners' discipline fluency. We analyze the faculty-produced Think-Pair-Share questions with our curriculum characterization framework, then apply our curriculum development framework to generate (1) Fluency-Inspiring Questions, a more pedagogically powerful extension of a well-established instructional strategy, and (2) Student Representation Tasks, a brand new type of instructional activity in astronomy that shifts the responsibility for generating appropriate representations onto the learners. We explicitly unpack and provide examples of Fluency-Inspiring Questions and Student Representation Tasks, detailing their usage of Pedagogical Discipline Representations coupled with novel question and activity formats.},

Here, we present a search for turn-on CLAGN in a complete sample of galaxies, using archival spectra and recent light curves.

We first establish typical variability behaviour for different AGN types, as recorded between 2001 and 2009, and then select outliers from the bulk behaviour as CLAGN candidates. We obtain new spectra for the candidates and identify 12 new turn-on CLAGN (appearing broad H\${\textbackslash}beta\$ line) and 19 new turn-off CLAGN (disappearing broad H\${\textbackslash}beta\$ line). We may have missed AGN that changed and reverted their state over the 15\$-\$20 years since 6dFGS spectra were taken, and thus our CLAGN rates of 1.7\${\textbackslash}\%\$ for turn-on and 9.6\${\textbackslash}\%\$ for turn-off are lower limits. The turn-on rate is naturally much lower as the type 1.9/2 sample is dominated by obscured AGN due to orientation, which are not expected to change. However, the number of turn-on (27) and turn-off (24) CLAGN we find are similar, suggesting that our parent AGN sample is reasonably complete in our search volume at \$z{\textless}0.1\$.},

	abstract = {While once rare, observations of stars being tidally disrupted by supermassive black holes are quickly becoming commonplace. To continue to learn from these events, it is necessary to robustly and systematically compare our growing number of observations with theory. We present a tidal disruption module for the Modular Open Source Fitter for Transients (MOSFiT) and the results from fitting 14 tidal disruption events (TDEs). Our model uses FLASH simulations of TDEs to generate bolometric luminosities and passes these luminosities through viscosity and reprocessing transformation functions to create multiwavelength light curves. It then uses an MCMC fitting routine to compare these theoretical light curves with observations. We find that none of the events show evidence for viscous delays exceeding a few days, supporting the theory that our current observing strategies in the optical/UV are missing a significant number of viscously delayed flares. We find that the events have black hole masses of 106-108 M ⊙ and that the masses we predict are as reliable as those based on bulk galaxy properties. We also find that there is a preference for stars with mass {\textless}1 M ⊙, as expected when low-mass stars greatly outnumber high-mass stars.},

	abstract = {Extreme coronal line emitters (ECLEs) are objects showing transient high-ionization lines in the centers of galaxies. They have been attributed to echoes of high-energy flares of ionizing radiation, such as those produced by tidal disruption events (TDEs), but have only recently been observed within hundreds of days after an optical transient was detected. AT 2022upj is a nuclear UV-optical flare at z=0.054 with spectra showing [Fe X] \{{\textbackslash}lambda\}6375 and [Fe XIV] \{{\textbackslash}lambda\}5303 during the optical peak, the earliest presence of extreme coronal lines during an ongoing transient. AT 2022upj is also the second ever ECLE (and first with a concurrent flare) to show broad He II \{{\textbackslash}lambda\}4686 emission, a key signature of optical/UV TDEs. We also detect X-ray emission during the optical transient phase, which may be related to the source of ionizing photons for the extreme coronal lines. Finally, we analyze the spectroscopic evolution of each emission line and find that [Fe X] and [Fe XIV] weaken within 400d of optical peak, while [Fe VII] \{{\textbackslash}lambda\}5720, [Fe VII] \{{\textbackslash}lambda\}6087, and [O III] \{{\textbackslash}lambda\}\{{\textbackslash}lambda\}4959,5007 emerge over the same period. The velocities of the iron lines indicate circumnuclear gas within 0.1pc of the central supermassive black hole (SMBH), while a dust echo inferred from NEOWISE data indicates that circumnuclear dust lies at a minimum of 0.4pc away, providing evidence of stratified material around a SMBH. AT 2022upj is the first confirmed ECLE-TDE with clear signatures of both classes. This event's spectroscopic evolution on a \${\textbackslash}sim\$year unveils the impact of highly energetic flares such as TDEs on the complex environments around SMBHs.},

	abstract = {The existence of optical-ultraviolet Tidal Disruption Events (TDEs) could be considered surprising because their electromagnetic output was originally predicted to be dominated by X-ray emission from an accretion disk. Yet over the last decade, the growth of optical transient surveys has led to the identification of a new class of optical transients occurring exclusively in galaxy centers, many of which are considered to be TDEs. Here we review the observed properties of these events, identified based on a shared set of both photometric and spectroscopic properties. We present a homogeneous analysis of 33 sources that we classify as robust TDEs, and which we divide into classes. The criteria used here to classify TDEs will possibly get updated as new samples are collected and potential additional diversity of TDEs is revealed. We also summarize current measurements of the optical-ultraviolet TDE rate, as well as the mass function and luminosity function. Many open questions exist regarding the current sample of events. We anticipate that the search for answers will unlock new insights in a variety of fields, from accretion physics to galaxy evolution.},

We find that their durations are anticorrelated with their spectral hardness ratios: short GRBs are predominantly harder, and longer ones tend to be softer.

	abstract = {Early studies of the time histories of the γ-ray burst events reported by the Vela satellites led to the suggestion that very brief, ∼ 0.1 s, bursts formed a class distinct from the longer, highly structured bursts1. Results of the KONUS experiments on Veneras 11, 12, 13 and 14 argue for the existence of a separate class of short-duration γ-ray bursts2, revealing that many of the short bursts exhibit much softer spectra ( ∼ 30 keV) than the more familiar complex bursts. Although this correlation is not completely clear and the observations are in some cases contradictory2–6, the existence of two γ-ray burst populations is suggested by Fig. 1, showing a duration histogram for 24 events detected by our ISEE-3 experiment. Figure 1 also shows the distribution of 123 Venera 13 and 14 events (60 detected by both spacecraft) and suggests two γ-ray burst populations in each experiment sample, the domains separated with a minimum near 1 or 2s. Here we point out that the results of the Goddard ISEE-3 γ-ray burst spectrometer actually enhance the appearance of two burst populations suggested in the Venera data.},

	abstract = {On 2017 August 17, the gravitational-wave event GW170817 was observed by the Advanced LIGO and Virgo detectors, and the gamma-ray burst (GRB) GRB 170817A was observed independently by the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor, and the Anti-Coincidence Shield for the Spectrometer for the International Gamma-Ray Astrophysics Laboratory. The probability of the near-simultaneous temporal and spatial observation of GRB 170817A and GW170817 occurring by chance is . We therefore confirm binary neutron star mergers as a progenitor of short GRBs. The association of GW170817 and GRB 170817A provides new insight into fundamental physics and the origin of short GRBs. We use the observed time delay of between GRB 170817A and GW170817 to: (i) constrain the difference between the speed of gravity and the speed of light to be between and times the speed of light, (ii) place new bounds on the violation of Lorentz invariance, (iii) present a new test of the equivalence principle by constraining the Shapiro delay between gravitational and electromagnetic radiation. We also use the time delay to constrain the size and bulk Lorentz factor of the region emitting the gamma-rays. GRB 170817A is the closest short GRB with a known distance, but is between 2 and 6 orders of magnitude less energetic than other bursts with measured redshift. A new generation of gamma-ray detectors, and subthreshold searches in existing detectors, will be essential to detect similar short bursts at greater distances. Finally, we predict a joint detection rate for the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor and the Advanced LIGO and Virgo detectors of 0.1–1.4 per year during the 2018–2019 observing run and 0.3–1.7 per year at design sensitivity.},

The significance of association between the gamma-ray burst observed by INTEGRAL and GW170817 is 3.2σ, while the association between the Fermi-GBM and INTEGRAL detections is 4.2σ. GRB 170817A was detected by the SPI-ACS instrument about 2 s after the end of the GW event. We measure a fluence of (1.4 ± 0.4 ± 0.6) × 10−7 erg cm−2 (75–2000 keV), where, respectively, the statistical error is given at the 1σ confidence level, and the systematic error corresponds to the uncertainty in the spectral model and instrument response. We also report on the pointed follow-up observations carried out by INTEGRAL, starting 19.5 hr after the event, and lasting for 5.4 days. We provide a stringent upper limit on any electromagnetic signal in a very broad energy range, from 3 keV to 8 MeV, constraining the soft gamma-ray afterglow flux to {\textless}7.1 × 10−11 erg cm−2 s−1 (80–300 keV). Exploiting the unique capabilities of INTEGRAL, we constrained the gamma-ray line emission from radioactive decays that are expected to be the principal source of the energy behind a kilonova event following a BNS coalescence. Finally, we put a stringent upper limit on any delayed bursting activity, for example, from a newly formed magnetar.},

This is the first unambiguous coincident observation of gravitational waves and electromagnetic radiation from a single astrophysical source and marks the start of gravitational-wave multi-messenger astronomy.

	abstract = {The discovery of GW170817 and GRB 170817A in tandem with AT 2017gfo cemented the connection between neutron star mergers, short gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), and kilonovae. To investigate short GRB observations in the context of diverse kilonova behavior, we present a comprehensive optical and near-IR catalog of 85 bursts discovered over 2005–2020 on timescales of 12 days. The sample includes previously unpublished observations of 23 bursts and encompasses both detections and deep upper limits. We identify 11.8\% and 15.3\% of short GRBs in our catalog with upper limits that probe luminosities lower than those of AT 2017gfo and a ﬁducial neutron star–black hole kilonova model (for pole-on orientations), respectively. We quantify the ejecta masses allowed by the deepest limits in our catalog, constraining blue and “extremely blue” kilonova components of 14.1\% of bursts to Mej  0.01–0.1 Me. The sample of short GRBs is not particularly constraining for red kilonova components. Motivated by the large catalog, as well as model predictions of diverse kilonova behavior, we investigate modiﬁed search strategies for future follow-up to short GRBs. We ﬁnd that ground-based optical and near-IR observations on timescales of 2 days can play a signiﬁcant role in constraining more diverse outcomes. We expect future short GRB follow-up efforts, such as from the James Webb Space Telescope, to expand the reach of kilonova detectability to redshifts of z ≈ 1.},

	abstract = {We present a comprehensive comparison of the properties of the radio through X-ray counterpart of GW170817 and the properties of short-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). For this effort, we utilize a sample of 36 short GRBs spanning a redshift range of z≈ 0.12\{--\}2.6 discovered over 2004-2017. We find that the counterpart to GW170817 has an isotropic-equivalent luminosity that is ≈ 3000 times less than the median value of on-axis short GRB X-ray afterglows, and ≳104 times less than that for detected short GRB radio afterglows. Moreover, the allowed jet energies and particle densities inferred from the radio and X-ray counterparts to GW170817 and on-axis short GRB afterglows are remarkably similar, suggesting that viewing angle effects are the dominant, and perhaps only, difference in their observed radio and X-ray behavior. From comparison to previous claimed kilonovae following short GRBs, we find that the optical and near-infrared (NIR) counterpart to GW170817 is comparatively under-luminous by a factor of ≈ 3\{--\}5, indicating a range of kilonova luminosities and timescales. A comparison of the optical limits following short GRBs on ≲ 1 day timescales also rules out a “blue” kilonova of comparable optical isotropic-equivalent luminosity in one previous short GRB. Finally, we investigate the host galaxy of GW170817, NGC 4993, in the context of short GRB host galaxy stellar population properties. We find that NGC 4993 is superlative in terms of its large luminosity, old stellar population age, and low star formation rate compared to previous short GRB hosts. Additional events within the Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO)/Virgo volume will be crucial in delineating the properties of the host galaxies of neutron star-neutron star (NS-NS) mergers, and connecting them to their cosmological counterparts.},

	abstract = {We present a systematic search for tidal disruption events (TDEs) using radio data from the Variables and Slow Transients (VAST) Pilot Survey conducted using the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder. Historically, TDEs have been identified using observations at X-ray, optical, and ultraviolet wavelengths. After discovery, a few dozen TDEs have been shown to have radio counterparts through follow-up observations. With systematic time-domain radio surveys becoming available, we can now identify new TDEs in the radio regime. A population of radio-discovered TDEs has the potential to provide several key insights including an independent constraint on their volumetric rate. We conducted a search to select variable radio sources with a single prominent radio flare and a position consistent within 2σ of the nucleus of a known galaxy. While TDEs were the primary target of our search, sources identified in this search may also be consistent with active galactic nuclei exhibiting unusual flux density changes at the timescales probed, uncharacteristically bright supernovae, or a population of gamma-ray bursts. We identify a sample of 12 radio-bright candidate TDEs. The timescales and luminosities range from ∼6 to 230 days and ∼10{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}38{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} to 10{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}41{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} erg s{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}‑1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}, respectively, consistent with models of radio emission from TDEs that launch relativistic jets.

	abstract = {The supernova (SN) PTF11iqb was initially classified as a Type IIn event caught very early after explosion. It showed narrow Wolf–Rayet (WR) spectral features on day 2 (as in SN 1998S and SN 2013cu), but the narrow emission weakened quickly and the spectrum morphed to resemble Types II-L and II-P. At late times, Hα exhibited a complex, multipeaked profile reminiscent of SN 1998S. In terms of spectroscopic evolution, we find that PTF11iqb was a near twin of SN 1998S, although with somewhat weaker interaction with circumstellar material (CSM) at early times, and stronger interaction at late times. We interpret the spectral changes as caused by early interaction with asymmetric CSM that is quickly (by day 20) enveloped by the expanding SN ejecta photosphere, but then revealed again after the end of the plateau when the photosphere recedes. The light curve can be matched with a simple model for CSM interaction (with a mass-loss rate of roughly 10−4 M⊙ yr−1) added to the light curve of a normal SN II-P. The underlying plateau requires a progenitor with an extended hydrogen envelope like a red supergiant at the moment of explosion, consistent with the slow wind speed (\&lt;80 km s−1) inferred from narrow Hα emission. The cool supergiant progenitor is significant because PTF11iqb showed WR features in its early spectrum – meaning that the presence of such WR features does not necessarily indicate a WR-like progenitor. Overall, PTF11iqb bridges SNe IIn with weaker pre-SN mass-loss seen in SNe II-L and II-P, implying a continuum between these types.},

	abstract = {Spectroscopically, tidal disruption events (TDEs) are characterized by broad (∼104 km s−1) emission lines and show a large diversity as well as different line profiles. After carefully and consistently performing a series of data reduction tasks including host galaxy light subtraction, we present here the first detailed, spectroscopic population study of 16 optical and UV TDEs. We study a number of emission lines prominent among TDEs including Hydrogen, Helium, and Bowen lines and we quantify their evolution with time in terms of line luminosities, velocity widths, and velocity offsets. We report a time lag between the peaks of the optical light curves and the peak luminosity of Hα spanning between ∼7 and 45 days. If interpreted as light echoes, these lags correspond to distances of ∼2 − 12 × 1016 cm, which are one to two orders of magnitudes larger than the estimated blackbody radii (RBB) of the same TDEs and we discuss the possible origin of this surprisingly large discrepancy. We also report time lags for the peak luminosity of the He I 5876 Å line, which are smaller than the ones of Hα for H TDEs and similar or larger for N III Bowen TDEs. We report that N III Bowen TDEs have lower Hα velocity widths compared to the rest of the TDEs in our sample and we also find that a strong X-ray to optical ratio might imply weakening of the line widths. Furthermore, we study the evolution of line luminosities and ratios with respect to their radii (RBB) and temperatures (TBB). We find a linear relationship between Hα luminosity and the RBB (Lline ∝ RBB) and potentially an inverse power-law relation with TBB (Lline ∝ TBB−β), leading to weaker Hα emission for TBB ≥ 25 000 K. The He II/He I ratio becomes large at the same temperatures, possibly pointing to an ionization effect. The He II/Hα ratio becomes larger as the photospheric radius recedes, implying a stratified photosphere where Helium lies deeper than Hydrogen. We suggest that the large diversity of the spectroscopic features seen in TDEs along with their X-ray properties can potentially be attributed to viewing angle effects.},

	abstract = {Array programming provides a powerful, compact and expressive syntax for accessing, manipulating and operating on data in vectors, matrices and higher-dimensional arrays. NumPy is the primary array programming library for the Python language. It has an essential role in research analysis pipelines in fields as diverse as physics, chemistry, astronomy, geoscience, biology, psychology, materials science, engineering, finance and economics. For example, in astronomy, NumPy was an important part of the software stack used in the discovery of gravitational waves1 and in the first imaging of a black hole2. Here we review how a few fundamental array concepts lead to a simple and powerful programming paradigm for organizing, exploring and analysing scientific data. NumPy is the foundation upon which the scientific Python ecosystem is constructed. It is so pervasive that several projects, targeting audiences with specialized needs, have developed their own NumPy-like interfaces and array objects. Owing to its central position in the ecosystem, NumPy increasingly acts as an interoperability layer between such array computation libraries and, together with its application programming interface (API), provides a flexible framework to support the next decade of scientific and industrial analysis.},

We report that NGC 2617 went through a dramatic outburst, during which its X-ray flux increased by over an order of magnitude followed by an increase of its optical/ultraviolet (UV) continuum flux by almost an order of magnitude. NGC 2617, classified as a Seyfert 1.8 galaxy in 2003, is now a Seyfert 1 due to the appearance of broad optical emission lines and a continuum blue bump. Such "changing look active galactic nuclei (AGNs)" are rare and provide us with important insights about AGN physics. Based on the Hβ line width and the radius-luminosity relation, we estimate the mass of central black hole (BH) to be (4 ± 1) × 107 M ⊙. When we cross-correlate the light curves, we find that the disk emission lags the X-rays, with the lag becoming longer as we move from the UV (2-3 days) to the NIR (6-9 days). Also, the NIR is more heavily temporally smoothed than the UV. This can largely be explained by a simple model of a thermally emitting thin disk around a BH of the estimated mass that is illuminated by the observed, variable X-ray fluxes.},

The present data covers the sky and spans ∼2-5 years with ∼100-400 epochs of observation. The data should contain some ∼1 million variable sources, and the ultimate goal is to have a database of these observations publicly accessible. We describe here a first step, a simple but unprecedented web interface https://asas-sn.osu.edu/ that provides an up to date aperture photometry light curve for any user-selected sky coordinate. The V band photometry is obtained using a two-pixel (16.″0) radius aperture and is calibrated against the APASS catalog. Because the light curves are produced in real time, this web tool is relatively slow and can only be used for small samples of objects. However, it also imposes no selection bias on the part of the ASAS-SN team, allowing the user to obtain a light curve for any point on the celestial sphere. We present the tool, describe its capabilities, limitations, and known issues, and provide a few illustrative examples.},

This goal is typically accomplished by dividing the task in two: collecting data (observing), and constructing models to represent that data (theorizing). Owing to the natural tendency for specialization, a disconnect can develop between the best available theories and the best available data, potentially delaying advances in our understanding new classes of transients. We introduce MOSFiT: the Modular Open Source Fitter for Transients, a Python-based package that downloads transient data sets from open online catalogs (e.g., the Open Supernova Catalog), generates Monte Carlo ensembles of semi-analytical light-curve fits to those data sets and their associated Bayesian parameter posteriors, and optionally delivers the fitting results back to those same catalogs to make them available to the rest of the community. MOSFiT is designed to help bridge the gap between observations and theory in time-domain astronomy; in addition to making the application of existing models and creation of new models as simple as possible, MOSFiT yields statistically robust predictions for transient characteristics, with a standard output format that includes all the setup information necessary to reproduce a given result. As large-scale surveys such as that conducted with the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST), discover entirely new classes of transients, tools such as MOSFiT will be critical for enabling rapid comparison of models against data in statistically consistent, reproducible, and scientifically beneficial ways.},

	abstract = {The tidal disruption of a star by a supermassive black hole provides us with a rare glimpse of these otherwise dormant beasts. It has long been predicted that the disruption will be accompanied by a thermal 'flare', powered by the accretion of bound stellar debris. Several candidate disruptions have been discovered in this manner at optical, ultraviolet and X-ray wavelengths. Here we explore the observational consequences if a modest fraction of the accretion power is channelled into an ultrarelativistic outflow. We show that a relativistic jet decelerates due to its interaction with the interstellar medium at subparsec distances from the black hole. Synchrotron radiation from electrons accelerated by the reverse shock powers a bright radio-infrared transient that peaks on a time-scale ∼1 yr after disruption. Emission from the forward shock may be detectable for several years after the peak. Deep radio follow-up observations of tidal disruption candidates at late times can test for the presence of relativistic ejecta. Upcoming radio transient surveys may independently discover tens to hundreds of tidal disruptions per year, complimenting searches at other wavelengths. Non-thermal emission from tidal disruption probes the physics of jet formation under relatively clean conditions.},

We investigate the possibility that jets launched with a time delay of days to months, interact with a debris that may expand outwards. We discuss the effects of the time delay and expansion velocity on the outcomes of jet breakout and collimation. We find that a jet with an isotropic-equivalent luminosity of \${\textbackslash}lesssim 5 {\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{45\}{\textbackslash},\{{\textbackslash}rm erg/s\}\$ is likely to be choked for a delay time of \${\textbackslash}sim 3\$ months. We also study the observational signatures of such delayed choked jets. The jet-debris interaction preceding the breakout would lead to particle acceleration and the resulting synchrotron emission can be detected by current and near-future radio, optical and X-ray telescopes, and the expanding jet-driven debris could explain late-time radio emission. We discuss high-energy neutrino production in delayed choked jets, and the time delay can significantly alleviate the difficulty of the hidden jet scenario in explaining neutrino coincidences.},

Such collisions will produce a characteristic burst of gravitational radiation, which may be the most promising source of a detectable signal for proposed gravity-wave detectors1. Such signals are sufficiently unique and robust for them to have been proposed as a means of determining the Hubble constant2. However, the rate of these neutron-star collisions is highly uncertain3. Here we note that such events should also synthesize neutron-rich heavy elements, thought to be formed by rapid neutron capture (the r-process)4. Furthermore, these collisions should produce neutrino bursts5 and resultant bursts of γ-rays; the latter should comprise a subclass of observable γ-ray bursts. We argue that observed r-process abundances and γ-ray-burst rates predict rates for these collisions that are both significant and consistent with other estimates.},

Bursts with complex profiles and relatively long durations are the result of magnetic flares generated by the Parker instability in a post-merger differentially-rotating disk. Some bursts may also be produced through neutrino-antineutrino annihilation into electrons and positrons. In both cases, an optically thick fireball of size \${\textbackslash}sles{\textbackslash} 100\$ km is initially created, which expands ultrarelativistically to large radii before radiating. Several previous objections to the cosmological merger model are eliminated. It is predicted that \${\textbackslash}gamma\$-ray bursts will be accompanied by a burst of gravitational radiation from the spiraling-in binary which could be detected by LIGO.},

Of the six events found after excluding all interacting Type IIn and Ia-CSM supernovae, three (PTF09ge, 09axc, and 09djl) are coincident with the centers of their hosts, one (10iam) is offset from the center, and a precise offset cannot be determined for two (10nuj and 11glr). All the central events have similar rise times to the He-rich tidal disruption candidate PS1-10jh, and the event with the best-sampled light curve also has similar colors and power-law decay. Spectroscopically, PTF09ge is He-rich, while PTF09axc and 09djl display broad hydrogen features around peak magnitude. All three central events are in low star formation hosts, two of which are E+A galaxies. Our spectrum of the host of PS1-10jh displays similar properties. PTF10iam, the one offset event, is different photometrically and spectroscopically from the central events, and its host displays a higher star formation rate. Finding no obvious evidence for ongoing galactic nuclei activity or recent star formation, we conclude that the three central transients likely arise from the tidal disruption of a star by a supermassive black hole. We compare the spectra of these events to tidal disruption candidates from the literature and find that all of these objects can be unified on a continuous scale of spectral properties. The accumulated evidence of this expanded sample strongly supports a tidal disruption origin for this class of nuclear transients.},

	abstract = {We present a toy model for the thermal optical/UV/X-ray emission from tidal disruption events (TDEs). Motivated by recent hydrodynamical simulations, we assume that the debris streams promptly and rapidly circularize (on the orbital period of the most tightly bound debris), generating a hot quasi-spherical pressure-supported envelope of radius R v {\textasciitilde} 1014 cm (photosphere radius {\textasciitilde}1015 cm) surrounding the supermassive black hole (SMBH). As the envelope cools radiatively, it undergoes Kelvin-Helmholtz contraction R v ∝ t -1, its temperature rising T eff ∝ t 1/2 while its total luminosity remains roughly constant; the optical luminosity decays as \${\textbackslash}nu \{L\}\_\{{\textbackslash}nu \}{\textbackslash}propto {\textbackslash},\{R\}\_\{v\}{\textasciicircum}\{2\}\{T\}\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{eff\}\}{\textbackslash}propto \{t\}{\textasciicircum}\{-3/2\}\$ . Despite this similarity to the mass fallback rate \$\{{\textbackslash}dot\{M\}\}\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{fb\}\}{\textbackslash}propto \{t\}{\textasciicircum}\{-5/3\}\$ , envelope heating from fallback accretion is subdominant compared to the envelope cooling luminosity except near optical peak (where they are comparable). Envelope contraction can be delayed by energy injection from accretion from the inner envelope onto the SMBH in a regulated manner, leading to a late-time flattening of the optical/X-ray light curves, similar to those observed in some TDEs. Eventually, as the envelope contracts to near the circularization radius, the SMBH accretion rate rises to its maximum, in tandem with the decreasing optical luminosity. This cooling-induced (rather than circularization-induced) delay of up to several hundred days may account for the delayed onset of thermal X-rays, late-time radio flares, and high-energy neutrino generation, observed in some TDEs. We compare the model predictions to recent TDE light-curve correlation studies, finding both agreement and points of tension.},

	abstract = {Recent studies suggest that tidal disruption events (TDEs) with off-axis jets may manifest as optically overluminous events. To search for jet signatures at late times, we conducted radio observations of eight such optically overluminous (\$M\_\{g, {\textbackslash}rm peak\} {\textless} -20.8\$ mag) TDEs with the Very Large Array. We detect radio counterparts in four events. The observed radio luminosities (\$L\_\{{\textbackslash}rm 6 GHz\} {\textbackslash}sim 10{\textasciicircum}\{38\}\$--\$10{\textasciicircum}\{39\}\$ erg s\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$) are two orders of magnitude lower than those of on-axis jetted TDEs, and we find no evidence for off-axis jets within rest-frame time of 3 yrs. Two of them (AT2022hvp and AT2021aeou) exhibit evolving radio emission, consistent with synchrotron emission from non-relativistic outflows launched near the time of first optical light. Two events (AT2020ysg and AT2020qhs) show no statistically significant variability, which can be attributed to either non-relativistic outflows or pre-existing active galactic nuclei. Compared to a control sample of fainter TDEs with \$M\_\{g, {\textbackslash}rm peak\} {\textgreater} -20.5\$ mag observed at similar rest-frame timescales (\$t\_\{{\textbackslash}rm rest\} {\textasciitilde} 1.5\${\textbackslash},yr), our sample shows systematically more luminous radio emission, suggesting that optically overluminous TDEs may launch more powerful prompt non-relativistic outflows. We speculate that strong general relativistic effects near high-mass black holes (\$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm BH\} {\textasciitilde} 10{\textasciicircum}8{\textbackslash},M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$) may play a key role. These findings motivate further investigation into the nature of relativistic disruptions around massive black holes and the physical conditions necessary for jet formation.},

The distribution of these bursts is isotropic across the sky, but inhomogeneous in space, with a deficit of faint bursts. It is currently unknown whether γ-ray bursts are produced in our Galaxy or at cosmological distances. The detection and identification of counterparts at other wavelengths are seen as crucial for resolving the origin of the events. Here we report the detection by the Beppo-SAX satellite of an X-ray `afterglow', associated with the γ-ray burst of 28 February 1997 (GRB970228; ref. 3)-the first such detection for any γ-ray burst. The X-ray transient was found to contain a significant fraction of the total energy of the γ-ray burst and, following the initial detection eight hours after the main burst, faded within a few days with a power-law decay function. The rapid locating of this γ-ray burst instigated a multi-wavelength observational campaign that culminated in the identification of a fading optical transient in a position consistent with the X-ray transient reported here.},

We show that the outflow was ejected on 2014 August 11-25, in agreement with an independent estimate of the timing of super-Eddington accretion based on the optical, ultraviolet, and X-ray observations, and that the ejected mass corresponds to about 1\%-10\% of the mass accreted in the super-Eddington phase. The temporal evolution of the radio emission also uncovers the circumnuclear density profile, ρ (R){\textbackslash}propto \{R\}-2.5 on a scale of about 0.01 pc, a scale that cannot be probed via direct measurements even in the nearest supermassive black holes. Our discovery of radio emission from the nearest well-studied TDE to date, with a radio luminosity lower than all previous limits, indicates that non-relativistic outflows are ubiquitous in TDEs, and that future, more sensitive, radio surveys will uncover similar events.},

In this work, we address the prospects for the LSST in discovering tidal disruption events (TDEs) and in probing the supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass distribution in the universe. We used the LSST simulation framework and defined TDE catalogs on 20 fields of 20.25 deg2 size. TDE properties were defined by randomly chosen impact factors and SMBH masses drawn from six different mass distributions. Observations of TDEs over 10 years of LSST operation were simulated by querying the simulated observing strategy database minion\_1016. Based on the results of our simulations, we estimate that the LSST should discover between 35,000 and 80,000 TDEs in 10 years of operation, depending on the assumed SMBH mass distribution. We also find that probing the SMBH mass distribution with TDE observations will not be straightforward, due to the fact that TDEs caused by low-mass black holes (105M⊙) are expected to be less luminous and shorter than TDEs by heavier SMBHs ({\textgreater} 106M⊙), and therefore will mostly be missed by the irregular LSST cadence minion\_1016.},

We have developed a new web-based target and observation manager (TOM) that allows us to coordinate sky surveys, vet potential counterparts, and trigger follow-up observations from one centralized portal. The TOM includes software that aggregates all publicly available information on the light curves and possible host galaxies of targets, allowing us to rule out potential contaminants like active galactic nuclei, variable stars, solar system objects, and preexisting supernovae, as well as to assess the viability of any plausible counterparts. We have also upgraded our image-subtraction pipeline by assembling deeper reference images and training a new neural-network-based real–bogus classifier. These infrastructure upgrades will aid coordination by enabling the prompt reporting of observations, discoveries, and analysis to the GW follow-up community, and put SAGUARO in an advantageous position to discover kilonovae in the remainder of O4 and beyond. Many elements of our open-source software stack have broad utility beyond multimessenger astronomy, and will be particularly relevant in the "big data" era of transient discoveries by the Vera C.

The minimum initial mass that can produce a supernova (SN) has converged to 8 ± 1 M from direct detections of red supergiant progenitors of II-P SNe and the most massive white dwarf progenitors, although this value is model dependent. It appears that most type Ibc SNe arise from moderate mass interacting binaries. The highly energetic, broad-lined Ic SNe are likely produced by massive, Wolf-Rayet progenitors. There is some evidence to suggest that the majority of massive stars above 20 M may collapse quietly to black holes and that the explosions remain undetected. The recent discovery of a class of ultrabright type II SNe and the direct detection of some progenitor stars bearing luminous blue variable characteristics suggest some very massive stars do produce highly energetic explosions. The physical mechanism is under debate, and these SNe pose a challenge to stellar evolutionary theory.},

It has long been clear that a SN Ia must be the runaway thermonuclear explosion of a degenerate carbon-oxygen stellar core, most likely a white dwarf (WD). However, the specific progenitor systems of SNe Ia, and the processes that lead to their ignition, have not been identified. Two broad classes of progenitor binary systems have long been considered: single-degenerate (SD), in which a WD gains mass from a nondegenerate star; and double-degenerate (DD), involving the merger of two WDs. New theoretical work has enriched these possibilities with some interesting updates and variants. We review the significant recent observational progress in addressing the progenitor problem. We consider clues that have emerged from the observed properties of the various proposed progenitor populations, from studies of SN Ia sites—pre- and postexplosion—from analysis of the explosions themselves and from the measurement of event rates. The recent nearby and well-studied event, SN 2011fe, has been particularly revealing. The observational results are not yet conclusive and sometimes prone to competing theoretical interpretations. Nevertheless, it appears that DD progenitors, long considered the underdog option, could be behind some, if not all, SNe Ia. We point to some directions that may lead to future progress.},

We further find a median mass-weighted age of t m = \$\{0.8\}\_\{-0.53\}{\textasciicircum}\{+2.71\}\$ Gyr, stellar mass of log(M */M ⊙) = \$\{9.69\}\_\{-0.65\}{\textasciicircum}\{+0.75\}\$ , star formation rate of SFR = \$\{1.44\}\_\{-1.35\}{\textasciicircum}\{+9.37\}\$ M ⊙ yr-1, stellar metallicity of log(Z */Z ⊙) = \$-\{0.38\}\_\{-0.42\}{\textasciicircum}\{+0.44\}\$ , and dust attenuation of \$\{A\}\_\{V\}=\{0.43\}\_\{-0.36\}{\textasciicircum}\{+0.85\}\$ mag (68\% confidence). Overall, the majority of short GRB hosts are star-forming (≈84\%), with small fractions that are either transitioning (≈6\%) or quiescent (≈10\%); however, we observe a much larger fraction (≈40\%) of quiescent and transitioning hosts at z ≲ 0.25, commensurate with galaxy evolution. We find that short GRB hosts populate the star-forming main sequence of normal field galaxies, but do not include as many high-mass galaxies as the general galaxy population, implying that their binary neutron star (BNS) merger progenitors are dependent on a combination of host star formation and stellar mass. The distribution of ages and redshifts implies a broad delay-time distribution, with a fast-merging channel at z {\textgreater} 1 and a decreased neutron star binary formation efficiency from high to low redshifts. If short GRB hosts are representative of BNS merger hosts within the horizon of current gravitational wave detectors, these results can inform future searches for electromagnetic counterparts.

We contribute 274 new multi-band imaging observations across 58 distinct GRBs and 26 spectra of their host galaxies. Supplemented by literature and archival survey data, the catalog contains 542 photometric and 42 spectroscopic data sets. The photometric catalog reaches 3σ depths of ≳24-27 mag and ≳23-26 mag for the optical and near-infrared bands, respectively. We identify host galaxies for 84 bursts, in which the most robust associations make up 56\% (50/90) of events, while only a small fraction, 6.7\%, have inconclusive host associations. Based on new spectroscopy, we determine 18 host spectroscopic redshifts with a range of z ≈ 0.15-1.5 and find that ≈23\%-41\% of Swift short GRBs originate from z {\textgreater} 1. We also present the galactocentric offset catalog for 84 short GRBs. Taking into account the large range of individual measurement uncertainties, we find a median of projected offset of ≈7.7 kpc, for which the bursts with the most robust associations have a smaller median of ≈4.8 kpc. Our catalog captures more high-redshift and low-luminosity hosts, and more highly offset bursts than previously found, thereby diversifying the population of known short GRB hosts and properties. In terms of locations and host luminosities, the populations of short GRBs with and without detectable extended emission are statistically indistinguishable. This suggests that they arise from the same progenitors, or from multiple progenitors, which form and evolve in similar environments.

The electrons producing these synchrotron radio flares could either be accelerated inside a relativistic jet or externally by shocks resulting from an outflow interacting with the circumnuclear medium. Until now, evidence for the internal emission mechanism has been lacking; nearly all tidal disruption flare studies have adopted the external shock model to explain the observed properties of radio flares. Here we report a result that presents a challenge to external emission models: we discovered a cross-correlation between the soft X-ray (0.3-1 keV) and 16 GHz radio flux of the tidal disruption flare ASASSN-14li. Variability features in the X-ray light curve appear again in the radio light curve, but after a time lag of \{12\}-5+6 days. This demonstrates that the soft X-ray-emitting accretion disk regulates the radio emission. This coupling appears to be inconsistent with all previous external emission models for this source but is naturally explained if the radio emission originates from a freely expanding jet. We show that emission internal to an adiabatically expanding jet can also reproduce the observed evolution of the radio spectral energy distribution. Furthermore, both the correlation between X-ray and radio luminosity as well as our radio spectral modeling imply an approximately linear coupling between the accretion rate and jet power.},

We focus here on the black hole and stellar masses of TDE host galaxies, their star formation histories and stellar populations, the concentration and morphology of the optical light, the presence of AGN activity, and the extra-galactic environment of the TDE hosts. We summarize the state of several possible explanations for the links between the TDE rate and host galaxy type. We present estimates of the TDE rate for different host galaxy types and quantify the degree to which rate enhancement in some types results in rate suppression in others. We discuss the possibilities for using TDE host galaxies to assist in identifying TDEs in upcoming large transient surveys and possibilities for TDE observations to be used to study their host galaxies.},

The decades-long baseline now enabled by large radio surveys allows us to identify cases where new outflows or jets have been launched. Here, we present the results of a targeted VLA program observing four post-starburst galaxies that have brightened significantly in radio emission over the past {\textasciitilde}20 years. We obtain quasi-simultaneous observations in five bands (1-18 GHz) for each source. We find peaked spectral energy distributions, indicative of self-absorbed synchrotron emission. While all four sources have risen significantly over the past {\textasciitilde}20 years in the 1-2 GHz band, two also show clear recent flares in the 2-4 GHz band. These sources are less luminous than typical peaked spectrum radio AGN. It remains unclear whether these sources are low luminosity analogs of the peaked radio AGN from accreted gas, or driven by tidal disruption events with missed optical flares. Regardless of the source of the accreted material, these newly-launched outflows contain sufficient energy to drive the molecular gas outflows observed in post-starburst galaxies and to drive turbulence suppressing star formation.},

Here, we introduce redback; a Bayesian inference software package for electromagnetic transients. redback provides an object-orientated python interface to over 12 different samplers and over 100 different models for kilonovae, supernovae, gamma-ray burst afterglows, tidal disruption events, engine-driven transients among other explosive transients. The models range in complexity from simple analytical and semi-analytical models to surrogates built upon numerical simulations accelerated via machine learning. redback also provides a simple interface for downloading and processing data from various catalogues such as Swift and FINK. The software can also serve as an engine to simulate transients for telescopes such as the Zwicky Transient Facility and Vera Rubin with realistic cadences, limiting magnitudes, and sky coverage or a hypothetical user-constructed survey or a generic transient for target-of-opportunity observations with different telescopes. As a demonstration of its capabilities, we show how redback can be used to jointly fit the spectrum and photometry of a kilonova, enabling a more powerful, holistic probe into the properties of a transient. We also showcase general examples of how redback can be used as a tool to simulate transients for realistic surveys, fit models to real, simulated, or private data, multimessenger inference with gravitational waves, and serve as an end-to-end software toolkit for parameter estimation and interpreting the nature of electromagnetic transients.},

	abstract = {We present fundamental scaling relationships between properties of the optical/UV light curves of tidal disruption events (TDEs) and the mass of the black hole that disrupted the star. We have uncovered these relations from the late-time emission of TDEs. Using a sample of 63 optically selected TDEs, the latest catalogue to date, we observed flattening of the early-time emission into a near-constant late-time plateau for at least two-thirds of our sources. Compared to other properties of the TDE light curves (e.g. peak luminosity or decay rate) the plateau luminosity shows the tightest correlation with the total mass of host galaxy (p-value of 2 × 10-6, with a residual scatter of 0.3 dex). Physically this plateau stems from the presence of an accretion flow. We demonstrate theoretically and numerically that the amplitude of this plateau emission is strongly correlated with black hole mass. By simulating a large population (N = 106) of TDEs, we determine a plateau luminosity-black hole mass scaling relationship well described by \${\textbackslash}log \_\{10\} {\textbackslash}left(\{\{M\_\{{\textbackslash}bullet \}\}/M\_{\textbackslash}odot \}{\textbackslash}right) = 1.50 {\textbackslash}log \_\{10\} {\textbackslash}left(\{ L\_\{{\textbackslash}rm plat\}\}/10{\textasciicircum}\{43\} {\textbackslash}, \{{\textbackslash}rm erg{\textbackslash}, s{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\}{\textbackslash}right) + 9.0\$ (here Lplat is measured at 6 × 1014 Hz in the rest frame). The observed plateau luminosities of TDEs and black hole masses in our large sample are in excellent agreement with this simulation. Using the black hole mass predicted from the observed TDE plateau luminosity, we reproduce the well-known scaling relations between black hole mass and galaxy velocity dispersion. The large black hole masses of 10 of the TDEs in our sample allow us to provide constraints on their black hole spins, favouring rapidly rotating black holes. Finally, we also discover two significant correlations between early time properties of optical TDE light curves (the g-band peak luminosity and radiated energy) and the TDEs black hole mass.},

We present Hubble Space Telescope far-UV (FUV) observations of eight optical/UV-selected TDFs 5-10 yr post-peak. Six sources are cleanly detected, showing point-like FUV emission (\{10\}41.5\{--42.5\} \{erg\} \{\{\{s\}\}\}-1) from the centers of their host galaxies. We discover that the light curves of TDFs from low-mass black holes ({\textless}106.5 M ⊙) show significant late-time flattening. Conversely, FUV light curves from high-mass black hole TDFs are generally consistent with an extrapolation from the early-time light curve. The observed late-time emission cannot be explained by existing models for early-time TDF light curves (i.e., reprocessing or circularization shocks), but is instead consistent with a viscously spreading, unobscured accretion disk. These disk models can only reproduce the observed FUV luminosities, however, if they are assumed to be thermally and viscously stable, in contrast to the simplest predictions of α-disk theory. For one TDF in our sample, we measure an upper limit to the UV luminosity that is significantly lower than expectations from theoretical modeling and an extrapolation of the early-time light curve. This dearth of late-time emission could be due to a disk instability/state change absent in the rest of the sample. The disk models that explain the late-time UV detections solve the TDF “missing energy problem” by radiating a rest-mass energy of ∼0.1 M ⊙ over a period of decades, primarily in extreme UV wavelengths.

	abstract = {Fulfilling the rich promise of rapid advances in time-domain astronomy is only possible through confronting our observations with physical models and extracting the parameters that best describe what we see. Here, we introduce REDBACK; a Bayesian inference software package for electromagnetic transients. REDBACK provides an object-orientated PYTHON interface to over 12 different samplers and over 100 different models for kilonovae, supernovae, gamma-ray burst afterglows, tidal disruption events, engine-driven transients among other explosive transients. The models range in complexity from simple analytical and semi-analytical models to surrogates built upon numerical simulations accelerated via machine learning. REDBACK also provides a simple interface for downloading and processing data from various catalogues such as Swift and FINK. The software can also serve as an engine to simulate transients for telescopes such as the Zwicky Transient Facility and Vera Rubin with realistic cadences, limiting magnitudes, and sky coverage or a hypothetical user-constructed survey or a generic transient for target-of-opportunity observations with different telescopes. As a demonstration of its capabilities, we show how REDBACK can be used to jointly fit the spectrum and photometry of a kilonova, enabling a more powerful, holistic probe into the properties of a transient. We also showcase general examples of how REDBACK can be used as a tool to simulate transients for realistic surveys, fit models to real, simulated, or private data, multimessenger inference with gravitational waves, and serve as an end-to-end software toolkit for parameter estimation and interpreting the nature of electromagnetic transients.},

We propose a new method to realize this potential based upon a physical model of optical/UV light production in which shocks near the apocenters of debris orbits dissipate orbital energy, which is then radiated from that region. Measurement of the optical/UV luminosity and color temperature at the peak of the flare leads directly to the two masses. The black hole mass depends mostly on the temperature observed at peak luminosity, while the mass of the disrupted star depends mostly on the peak luminosity. We introduce TDEMASS, a method to infer the black hole and stellar masses given these two input quantities. Using TDEMASS, we find, for 21 well-measured events, black hole masses between 5 × 105 and 107 M⊙ and disrupted stars with initial masses between 0.6 and 13 M⊙.

Additional, non-disc light curve and spectral components can be included to (for example) model the early time rise and decay of tidal disruption event light curves in optical-to-UV bands. Monte Carlo Markov Chain fitting procedures are included which return posterior distributions of black hole and disc parameters, allowing for the future automated processing of the large populations of transient sources discovered by (e.g.,) the Vera Rubin Observatory. As an explicit example, in this paper we model the multi-wavelength light curves of the tidal disruption event AT2019dsg, finding a good fit to the data, a black hole mass consistent with galactic scaling relationships, and a late-time disc Eddington ratio consistent with the observed launching of an outflow observed in radio bands.},

The XMM-Newton observations measure a soft X-ray blackbody component with \{\{kT\}\}\{bb\}∼ 45 \{eV\}, corresponding to radiation from several gravitational radii of a central ∼ \{10\}6 \{M\}⊙ black hole. The last Swift epoch taken almost 600 days after discovery shows that the X-ray source has faded back to its levels during the UV/optical peak. The timescale of the X-ray brightening suggests that the X-ray emission could be coming from delayed accretion through a newly forming debris disk and that the prompt UV/optical emission is from the prior circularization of the disk through stream-stream collisions. The lack of spectral evolution during the X-ray brightening disfavors ionization breakout of a TDE “veiled” by obscuring material. This is the first time a TDE has been shown to have a delayed peak in soft X-rays relative to the UV/optical peak, which may be the first clear signature of the real-time assembly of a nascent accretion disk, and provides strong evidence for the origin of the UV/optical emission from circularization, as opposed to reprocessed emission of accretion radiation.},

	abstract = {Context. After the discovery of the first connection between γ-ray bursts (GRBs) and supernovae (SNe) almost two decades ago, tens of SN-like rebrightenings have been discovered and about seven solid associations have been spectroscopically confirmed to date. Aims: We determine the luminosity, evolution, and origin of three SN rebrightenings in GRB afterglow light curves at z {\textasciitilde} 0.5 along with accurate determinations of the host-galaxy extinction. We estimate physical parameters of the SN explosions, such as synthesised 56Ni mass, ejecta mass, and kinetic energy. Methods: We employ GROND optical/NIR data and Swift X-ray/UV data to estimate the host-galaxy extinction by modelling the afterglow spectral energy distribution, to determine the SN luminosity and evolution, and to construct quasi-bolometric light curves. The latter are corrected for the contribution of the NIR-bands using data available in the literature and black-body fits. We employ Arnett's analytic approach to obtain the physical parameters of the explosion. Results: The SNe 2008hw, 2009nz, and 2010ma observed by GROND exhibit 0.80, 1.15, and 1.78 times the optical (r'-band) luminosity of SN 1998bw, respectively. While SN 2009nz exhibits an evolution similar to SN 1998bw, SNe 2008hw and 2010ma show earlier peak times. The quasi-bolometric light curves (340-2200 nm) confirm the large luminosity of SN 2010ma (1.4 × 1043 erg s-1), while SNe 2008hw and 2009nz reached a peak luminosity closer to that of SN 1998bw. The modelling indicates in 56Ni masses of around 0.4-0.5 M⊙. Conclusions: By means of a very comprehensive data set, we found that the luminosity and the 56Ni mass of SNe 2008hw, 2009nz, and 2010ma resembles those of other known GRB-associated SNe. These findings strengthens previous claims of GRB-SNe being brighter than stripped-envelope SNe unaccompanied by GRBs. Appendices are available in electronic form at http://www.aanda.org},

	abstract = {We describe how the various outcomes of stellar tidal disruption give rise to observable radiation. We separately consider the cases where gas circularizes rapidly into an accretion disc, as well as the case when shocked debris streams provide the observable emission without having fully circularized. For the rapid circularization case, we describe how outflows, absorption by reprocessing layers, and Comptonization can cause the observed radiation to depart from that of a bare disc, possibly giving rise to the observed optical/UV emission along with soft X-rays from the disc. If, instead, most of the debris follows highly eccentric orbits for a significant time, many properties of the observed optical/UV emission can be explained by the scale of those eccentric orbits and the shocks embedded in the debris flow near orbital apocenter. In this picture, soft X-ray emission at early times results from the smaller amount of debris mass deflected into a compact accretion disc by weak shocks near the stellar pericenter. A general proposal for the near-constancy of the ultraviolet/optical color temperatures is provided, by linking it to incomplete thermalization of radiation in the atmosphere of the emitting region. We also briefly discuss the radio signals from the interaction of unbound debris and jets with the black hole environment.},

We present a new parametric analytical model that can accommodate a broad range of SN LC morphologies, including those with a plateau, and fit this model to data in four PS1 filters (g P1 r P1 i P1 z P1). We test a number of feature extraction methods, data augmentation strategies, and machine-learning algorithms to predict the class of each SN. Our best pipelines result in ≈90\% average accuracy, ≈70\% average purity, and ≈80\% average completeness for all SN classes, with the highest success rates for SNe Ia and SLSNe and the lowest for SNe Ibc. Despite the greater complexity of our classification scheme, the purity of our SN Ia classification, ≈95\%, is on par with methods developed specifically for Type Ia versus non-Type Ia binary classification. As the first of its kind, this study serves as a guide to developing and training classification algorithms for a wide range of SN types with a purely empirical training set, particularly one that is similar in its characteristics to the expected LSST main survey strategy. Future work will implement this classification pipeline on ≈3000 PS1/MDS LCs that lack spectroscopic classification.},

Yet this luminous flare can be reprocessed by gas or dust that inhabits a galactic nucleus, resulting in multiple reverberation signals. Nuclear dust heated by the TDE will lead to an echo at infrared wavelengths (1-10 μm) and transient coronal lines in optical spectra of TDEs trace reverberation by gas that orbits the black hole. Both of these signal have been detected, here we review this rapidly developing field. We also review the results that have been extracted from TDEs with high-quality X-ray light curves: quasi periodic oscillations (QPOs), reverberation lags of fluorescence lines, and cross-correlations with emission at other wavelengths. The observational techniques that are covered in this review probe the emission from TDEs over a wide range of scales: from \${\textbackslash}sim 1\$ light year to the innermost parts of the newly formed accretion disk. They provide insights into important properties of TDEs such as their bolometric output and the geometry of the accretion flow. While reverberation signals are not detected for every TDE, we anticipate they will become more commonplace when the next generation of X-ray and infrared instruments become operational.},

This chapter both reviews those events that are unusual relative to other TDEs, including the possibility of TDEs in pre-existing AGN, and summarises those characteristics thought to best distinguish TDEs from continuously accreting AGN, strongly flaring AGN, SNe, and Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs), as well as other potential impostors like stellar collisions, “micro-TDEs,” and circumbinary accretion flows. We conclude that multiple observables should be used to classify any one event as a TDE. We also consider the TDE candidate population as a whole, which, for certain host galaxy or SMBH characteristics, is distinguishable statistically from non-TDEs, suggesting that at least some TDE candidates do in fact arise from SMBH-disrupted stars.},

	abstract = {Observational astronomy of tidal disruption events (TDEs) began with the detection of X-ray flares from quiescent galaxies during the ROSAT all-sky survey of 1990–1991. The flares complied with theoretical expectations, having high peak luminosities (\$L\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{x\}\}\$up to \${\textbackslash}ge 4{\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{44\}{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}text\{erg/s\}\$), a thermal spectrum with \$kT{\textbackslash}sim {\textbackslash}text\{few\} {\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{5\}{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}text\{K\}\$, and a decline on timescales of months to years, consistent with a diminishing return of stellar debris to a black hole of mass \$10{\textasciicircum}\{6{\textbackslash}text\{--\}8\}{\textasciitilde}M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot \}\$. These measurements gave solid proof that the nuclei of quiescent galaxies are habitually populated by a super-massive black hole. Beginning in 2000, XMM-Newton, Chandra and Swift have discovered further TDEs which have been monitored closely at multiple wavelengths. A general picture has emerged of, initially near-Eddington accretion, powering outflows of highly-ionised material, giving way to a calmer sub-Eddington phase, where the flux decays monotonically, and finally a low accretion rate phase with a harder X-ray spectrum indicative of the formation of a disk corona. There are exceptions to this rule though which at the moment are not well understood. A few bright X-ray TDEs have been discovered in optical surveys but in general X-ray TDEs show little excess emission in the optical band, at least at times coincident with the X-ray flare. X-ray TDEs are powerful new probes of accretion physics down to the last stable orbit, revealing the conditions necessary for launching jets and winds. Finally we see that evidence is mounting for nuclear and non-nuclear intermediate mass black holes based on TDE flares which are relatively hot and/or fast.},

	abstract = {Main-sequence disruptions of stars by supermassive black holes result in the production of an extended, geometrically thin debris stream winding repeatedly around the black hole. In the absence of black hole spin, in-plane relativistic precession causes this stream to intersect with itself after a single winding. In this paper we show that relativistic precessions arising from black hole spin can induce deflections out of the original orbital plane that prevent the stream from self-intersecting even after many windings. This naturally leads to a “dark period” in which the flare is not observable for some time, persisting for up to a dozen orbital periods of the most bound material, which translates to years for disruptions around black holes with masses . When the stream eventually self-intersects, the distance from the black hole and the angle at which this collision occurs determine the rate of energy dissipation. We find that more-massive black holes () tend to have more violent stream self-intersections, resulting in prompt accretion. For these tidal disruption events (TDEs), the accretion rate onto the black hole should still closely follow the original fallback rate after a fixed delay time , . For lower black hole masses (), we find that flares are typically slowed down by about an order of magnitude, resulting in the majority of TDEs being sub-Eddington at peak. This also implies that current searches for TDEs are biased toward prompt flares, with slowed flares likely having been unidentified.},

	abstract = {Tidal disruption events (TDEs) have been proposed as valuable laboratories for studying dormant black holes. However, progress in this field has been hampered by the limited number of observed events. In this work, we present TDECat, a comprehensive catalogue of 134 confirmed TDEs (131 optical TDEs and 3 jetted TDEs) discovered up to the end of 2024, accompanied by multi-wavelength photometry (X-ray, UV, optical, and IR) and publicly available spectra. We also study the statistical properties, spectral classifications, and multi-band variability of these events. Using a Bayesian Blocks algorithm, we determine the duration, rise time , decay time, and their ratio for 103 flares in our sample. We find that these timescales follow a log-normal distribution. Furthermore, our spectral analysis shows that most optical TDEs belong to the TDE-H+He class, followed by the TDE-H, TDE-He, and TDE-featureless classes, which is consistent with expectations from main sequence star disruption. Using archival observations, we identify four new potentially repeating TDEs, namely AT 2024pvu, AT 2022exr, AT2021uvz, and AT 2019teq, increasing the number of known repeating events. In both newly identified and previously known cases, the secondary flares exhibit a similar shape to the primary. We also examine the IR and X-ray emission from the TDEs in our catalogue, and find that 14 out of the 18 IR events have associated X-ray emission, strongly suggesting a potential correlation. Finally, we find that for three subsamples (repeating flares, IR-, and X-ray-emitting events), the spectral classes are unlikely to be randomly distributed, suggesting a connection between spectral characteristics and multi-wavelength emission. TDEcat enables large-scale population studies across wavelengths and spectral classes, providing essential tools for navigating the data-rich era of upcoming surveys such as the LSST.},

Our sample concentrates on candidates from the 15 events (published in GWTC-2, GWTC-3, or not retracted on GraceDB) that had a {\textgreater}1\% chance of including a neutron star in order to assess their viability as true kilonovae. In particular, we leverage tools available in real time, including pre-merger detections and cross-matching with catalogs (i.e., point-source, variable-star, quasar and host-galaxy redshift data sets), to eliminate 65\% of candidates in our sample. We further employ spectroscopic classifications, late-time detections, and light-curve behavior analyses and conclude that 66 candidates remain viable kilonovae. These candidates lack sufficient information to determine their classifications, and the majority would require luminosities greater than that of AT 2017gfo. Pre-merger detections in public photometric survey data and comparison of cataloged host-galaxy redshifts with the GW event distances are critical to incorporate into vetting procedures, as these tools eliminated {\textgreater}20\% and {\textgreater}30\% of candidates, respectively. We expect that such tools that leverage archival information will significantly reduce the strain on spectroscopic and photometric follow-up resources in future observing runs. Finally, we discuss the critical role prompt updates from GW astronomers to the EM community play in reducing the number of candidates requiring vetting.},
