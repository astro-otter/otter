-------------------------------------------------------

OTTER is a catalog of data on transient sources. It is focused on
tidal disruption event photometry for now but will expand in the future
if the interest is there. This page hosts the documentation for OTTER
API which allows users to easily access and visualize the complex
multiwavelength datasets hosted in OTTER.
