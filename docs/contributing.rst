Reporting Issues, Providing Feedback, and Seeking Support
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Please report any bugs, issues, or suggestions by opening an issue at
https://github.com/astro-otter/otter/issues/new/choose. You should also feel
free to open an issue just with questions if something in the documentation
is unclear. Typically, questions like these are very useful and will lead to
additions or clarifications on our documentation page! We monitor new
issues opened here and will provide additional guidance and/or next steps.

Contributing
^^^^^^^^^^^^
Please use the following Git/GitHub workflow if you wish to make contributions:

#. Fork this repository
#. Following the Developer Installation above to install the API locally. Feel free to open an issue or reach out with any problems.
#. When you have finished your contribution (or have reached a stable point in your development), please open a Pull Request from your fork.

We monitor the opened pull requests and will discuss any implementation details
with you there, if necessary.
